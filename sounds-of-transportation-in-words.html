In most parts of the world there are not as many crocodiles as there used to be. This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necesssary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people must take care of crocodiles’ environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals. Source: Pike and Mumper (2004) Type: Purpose: Signal Words: 2. Recently, scientists have gained an understanding of a crocodile’s reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate in the water, where the buoyancy keeps them from crushing each other. Prior to mating, there are stylized postures, jumping, submerged bubble blowing, and snout contact. After mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a nest, in a hole scooped in the sand. When it is time to hatch, the infant crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound that leads the female to the nest, which she excavates. Finally, when all the babies are accounted for, the mother crocodile, transports them to the shallow water where they will remain under adult protection for months.

Recently, scientists have gained an
understanding of a crocodile's
reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate
in the water, where the buoyancy
keeps them from crushing each other.
Prior to mating, there are stylized
postures, jumping, submerged bubble
blowing, and snout contact. After
mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a
nest, in a hole scooped in the sand.
When it is time to hatch, the infant
crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound
that leads the female to the nest,
which she excavates. Finally, when all
the babies are accounted for the
mother crocodile, transports them to
the shallow water where they will
remain under adult protection for
weeks or months.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>AORTA<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The<strong> aorta i</strong>s the primary conduit that diverts blood from your heart to the remainder of your body. The blood leaves the heart through the <strong>aortic </strong>valve. Then, at that point, it goes through the <strong>aorta</strong>, making a stick molded bend that permits other significant conduits to convey oxygen-rich blood to the cerebrum, muscles and different cells. The <strong>aorta </strong>is the biggest vein in the body. This vein is answerable for moving oxygen rich blood from your heart to the remainder of your body. The<strong> aorta </strong>starts at the left ventricle of the heart, stretching out vertical into the chest to shape a curve.
</p><p>
</p><p>The results can be destructive. Upwards of 40% of individuals who experience<strong> aortic</strong> analyzation pass on in a split second, and the danger of death increments by 3-4 percent consistently the condition is left untreated. The <strong>aorta</strong> is the enormous conduit that conveys oxygen-rich blood from the passed on ventricle of the heart to different pieces of the body. The analyzation may gradually mend all alone or cause a burst in the <strong>aortic </strong>divider. Contingent upon the size, such a break can kill somebody in a split second or inside two or three days.</p><p></p><p>What is the function of aorta:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/341120</p><p></p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

In most parts of the world there are not as many crocodiles as there used to be. This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necesssary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people must take care of crocodiles’ environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.

Crocodiles mate in the water, where the buoyancy keeps them from crushing each other. Prior to mating, there are stylized postures, jumping, submerged bubble blowing, and snout contact. After mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a nest, in a hole scooped in the sand. When it is time to hatch, the infant crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound that leads the female to the nest, which she excavates.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The parts of the respiratory system:  </p><p>
</p><p>Nostrils – the entrance to the nasal passage. It is where the air enters.  </p><p>Nasal passage – lined with coarse hair that filters the air and traps microorganisms and dust particles. It has a mucous membrane and supplies with blood capillaries capable of warming and moistening the air that is breathed in preventing damage of delicate lung tissues.  </p><p>Pharynx – serves as a passageway of air from the mouth to the trachea.  </p><p>
</p><p>Larynx – it is known as the “voice box”. Allows air to pass through while keeping food and drink from blocking the airway.  It has vocal cords that produces the sound of speech and while singing.  </p><p>Trachea (windpipe) – passage that connects the throat and the lungs.  </p><p>Bronchial tubes (Bronchi) – tubes at the bottom of the trachea into each lung.  </p><p>Bronchioles – small branches of the bronchial tubes that lead to the alveoli.  </p><p>Alveoli – tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of gases of oxygen and carbon dioxide take place.  </p><p>Diaphragm – the muscle that helps your lungs pulls in air and pushes it out.  </p><p>Lungs – two organs that remove oxygen from the air and pass it into your blood.  </p><p>Pleura –thin sacs that surround each lung lobe and separate your lungs from the chest walls.  </p><p>
</p><p>How do the Lungs work?  
</p><p>
</p><p>Your lungs are located in the center of your chest. They are big enough to take up most of the space within your body. The left and right lungs are separated by a small space. The left lung is bigger than the right lung because it provides room for the heart.
</p><p>Movement of the diaphragm during Respiration                                              </p><p>Breathing is the process of inhaling and exhaling. This mechanism is designed to carry oxygen through the blood and distribute it to all cells in the body.
</p><p>During inhalation you breathe in or inhale to bring in air into your lungs. When you inhale the rib and diaphragm muscles will contract and your chest cavity becomes larger. Air pressure in chest cavity is less than outside the body causing the air outside rushing into the lungs.
</p><p>During exhalation you breathe out or exhale to avoid carbon dioxide or waste gases. In this part the rib and diaphragm muscles are relaxed. Your chest cavity becomes smaller. Air pressure inside your chest cavity is greater than the outside of your body.  Air rushes out of your lungs to the outside.  </p><p>
</p><p>Components of the circulatory system
</p><p>  </p><p>Your circulatory system has the function to supply the needed nutrients and other useful substances necessary for our body to function efficiently.  It has three components namely,  </p><p>a.	the blood – the fluid animals, including man, that delivers important substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transport metabolic wastes away from those cells.
</p><p>b.	blood vessels – tubular structure that transport blood through the tissues  
</p><p>and organs.  It could be an artery, vein and capillary.
</p><p>c.	Heart – the main organ of the circulatory system that pumps blood to all  </p><p>    parts of the body. </p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Types of Circulation: Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation  </p><p>
</p><p>Pulmonary  circulation  is  the movement of the blood from the heart to the lungs via pulmonary artery where oxygen diffuses to the blood while carbon dioxide leaves the bloodstream.  The oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Systemic circulation is the pathway of the blood from the heart to the capillaries of the different organs of the body and back to the heart.  The oxygenated blood from the heart leaves via the largest artery-the aorta.    
</p><p>Upon reaching the capillaries of the different organs of the body diffusions of nutrients and oxygen takes place and the same time wastes materials enter into the bloodstream and returns to the heart.    </p><p>
</p><p>How will the heart do this job?  
</p><p>Blood (deoxygenated) from the different parts of the body enter via superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). It will be received by the right atrium (RA) and pushed into the right ventricle (RV). Tricuspid valve is in between them to avoid back flow of the blood. The blood is pumped by the RV via pulmonary artery, where exchange of gases takes place in the lungs (in the presence of alveoli).  The blood (oxygenated) is received by the left atrium (LA) via pulmonary vein and pushed into the left ventricle (LV). Bicuspid valve is in between these chambers to avoid back flow of the blood. The blood is pumped into the aorta and is brought into the different cells/parts of the body.  
</p><p>
</p><p>HOW WILL THE RESPIRATORY AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER?  </p><p>
</p><p>The respiratory and circulatory systems worked intimately with each other making it sure that the cells and tissues receive oxygen hence it is needed for cellular function. The air we breathe in is held in the lungs and is transferred to the blood. The blood is moved to the heart and is pumped to the different parts of the body. Likewise, both are responsible for the removal of wastes such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2).  </p><p>

keeps them from crushing each other.
Prior to mating, there are stylized
postures, jumping, submerged bubble
blowing, and snout contact. After
mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a
nest, in a hole scooped in the sand.
When it is time to hatch, the infant
crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound
that leads the female to the nest,
which she excavates. Finally, when all
the babies are accounted for the
mother crocodile, transports them to
the shallow water where they will
remain under adult protection for
weeks or months.

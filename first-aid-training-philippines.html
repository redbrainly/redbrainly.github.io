                                            Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor. (name) on how they prepare if there the province of Bulacan hit by a natural disaster. Good afternoon, Mayor. (NAME!!), we’re here to ask you some question on (1) How you and your local government do to prepare for natural disaster occurs in the province of Malolos, Bulacan. (2) Are your local governments ready to provide assistance after disaster?(3) Is there any activities in your community after the disaster? If there's any, what are those? (4) As a local government official what can you do to help?Conclusion.Outro.​</a>

                            21. Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor. (name) on how they prepare if there the province of Bulacan hit by a natural disaster. Good afternoon, Mayor. (NAME!!), we’re here to ask you some question on (1) How you and your local government do to prepare for natural disaster occurs in the province of Malolos, Bulacan. (2) Are your local governments ready to provide assistance after disaster?(3) Is there any activities in your community after the disaster? If there's any, what are those? (4) As a local government official what can you do to help?Conclusion.Outro.​</h2><br />

                            24. Scenario 2: Health and Safety at WorkManny recently started working for a construction company. His supervisor told him thatbecause he was so smart and fit for the job, he did not need training in the use of theequipment. He would learn by doing instead. One day he was trying to use a table saw thathe had never used before. He cut himself badly on one of his hands, and it began to bleedprofusely, but he did not know where the first aid kit was located.What is the issue?What does the Philippine law says abouthealth and safety at work?How can such a situation be prevented inthe future?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The issue is the supervisor based the qualifications on Manny's personality not on Manny's skills to the job. Philippine law have a weak policies on health and safety at work. This can be avoided if there is a stronger Philippine law regarding health and safety at work. Supervisors should hire based on skills not based on personality and family backgrounds.</p><br />

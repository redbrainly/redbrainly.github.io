First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

                                            Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair; pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air; it feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning; I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack-tack
I think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I'd have a heart attack)

                                            All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</a>

That's how I describe her. First day ofclass, she immediately extended her hands to me, trying to make friends with me. ButI was a shy type boy back then, so I did not respond. However, with the golden heartthat she had which is still true until now, she didn't not give up on me. She kept onsaying hi and hello even though I wasn't returning the same kind of vibe to her. Sheeven shared with me her snacks during our break time. Because of that determination,she finally won my heart. We started hanging out together and became so close to thepoint that people suspect that we are dating. But, in all honesty, Rina and I are justbest friends. That's why I my gift for her tonight is a bracelet beaded with energy stonesto remind her that she is one of the sources of my energy. Happy 18th birthday mydearest best friend Rina!Let's talk about the CONTENT:a. What is the purpose of the speech?​</a>

But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, saying, "It's a mistake"
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Here's your perfect</a>

                                            Read The Story of The Carrot, The Egg, and The Coffee Bean A young girl went to her grandmother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed that, as one problem was solved, a new one arose. Her grandmother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes, she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her granddaughter, she asked, "Tell me, what do you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," the young girl replied. The grandmother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The granddaughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma. The granddaughter then asked, "What does it Her grandmother explained that each of these objects mean, grandmother?" had faced the same adversity boiling water but each reacted differently.  ​</a>

the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

                                            Day 11 FINDING NEMO Nemo is a naughty fish. He wants to know everything. He even break the rules set by his parents, like wandering from place to place. "I want to see the different parts of the sea, Father!" he reasoned out. "There is always time for everything, Nemo. When you grow up, we will let you do everything you want!" He always got scolded whenever he went too far from their home, which is the coral reef. He envied his friends who are able to go to different places. "Why are they allowed to do whatever they want?" he said to himself. One day he courageously explored the sea. He also wanted to be popular. Nemo, mesmerized by the sights was unaware that he was going too far. He didn't know that he had already entered the territory of the ferocious sharks. He hid behind the coral reefs when he saw two sharks passing by. "?They are so enormous. I didn't know there are fish like them," he said. He was so fright- ened when he saw the fishes that the sharks are going to attack. "My friends! they are also here!" Nemo saw how the sharks gobbled up the little fishes. He was so afraid. He carefully hid himself into the corals even if he was already hungry. Every minute, a shark was passing around the coral where he was hiding. "They knew I was here," he told himself. He was so afraid, he cried. He regretted his disobedience to his parents. Long hours went by. Nemo heard somebody calling him. "Psst, little fish. Come I will save you!" An old squid called him. They had not gone far when they saw some sharks run- ning after them. The squid immediately squirted inky liquid. "I can't see!" one shark cried. "Me too!" shrieked the others. The old squid accompanied Nemo to his parents. "We were so worried about you," his mother cried. "Forgive me. Promise, I will not go away from our home again," he said.​</a>

                                            geuss the tittle
It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
There's always something that's standing in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no looking back
There ain't no one to prove, we don't got this on lock, yeah
The wait is over
The time is now, so let's do it right
Yeah, we'll keep going
And stay up until we see the sunrise
And we'll say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
No, we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Well, let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive, mmm
'Cause it's not over
Till it's over, say it one more time, say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going (the music's got me going)
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah (hey)
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools (like we're dancing fools)
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

The trouble was it fell on me and I and water dont agree  A lot of christeners stood and listened: I let them know that I was Christened 6.Winter is cold It is Winder Never Hot There are children playing Especially freezing  Really Cold 7."A noiseless patient spider, I mark'd where on a little promontory is stood isolated, Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, It launch'd forth filament,filament,filament, out kf itself  Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them 8.How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's  Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love with a passion put to use  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love these with a love I seem to lose  With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath  Smiles, tears, of all my life!and if God choose I shall but love thee better after death 9. I'm ready to take on a taut strand,but I'd rather take the slack,one,for I could go far that way 10.A touch of cold in the Autumn night I walked abroad, And saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge  Like a Red-faced farmer​ ​</a>

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

                            8. Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair; pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air; it feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning; I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack-tack
I think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I'd have a heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack</h2><br />

                            13. All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</h2><br />

                            17. Read The Story of The Carrot, The Egg, and The Coffee Bean A young girl went to her grandmother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed that, as one problem was solved, a new one arose. Her grandmother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes, she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her granddaughter, she asked, "Tell me, what do you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," the young girl replied. The grandmother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The granddaughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma. The granddaughter then asked, "What does it Her grandmother explained that each of these objects mean, grandmother?" had faced the same adversity boiling water but each reacted differently.  ​</h2><br />

the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my

                            21. THE SONG IS BELIEVER
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</h2><br />

                            22. Day 11 FINDING NEMO Nemo is a naughty fish. He wants to know everything. He even break the rules set by his parents, like wandering from place to place. "I want to see the different parts of the sea, Father!" he reasoned out. "There is always time for everything, Nemo. When you grow up, we will let you do everything you want!" He always got scolded whenever he went too far from their home, which is the coral reef. He envied his friends who are able to go to different places. "Why are they allowed to do whatever they want?" he said to himself. One day he courageously explored the sea. He also wanted to be popular. Nemo, mesmerized by the sights was unaware that he was going too far. He didn't know that he had already entered the territory of the ferocious sharks. He hid behind the coral reefs when he saw two sharks passing by. "?They are so enormous. I didn't know there are fish like them," he said. He was so fright- ened when he saw the fishes that the sharks are going to attack. "My friends! they are also here!" Nemo saw how the sharks gobbled up the little fishes. He was so afraid. He carefully hid himself into the corals even if he was already hungry. Every minute, a shark was passing around the coral where he was hiding. "They knew I was here," he told himself. He was so afraid, he cried. He regretted his disobedience to his parents. Long hours went by. Nemo heard somebody calling him. "Psst, little fish. Come I will save you!" An old squid called him. They had not gone far when they saw some sharks run- ning after them. The squid immediately squirted inky liquid. "I can't see!" one shark cried. "Me too!" shrieked the others. The old squid accompanied Nemo to his parents. "We were so worried about you," his mother cried. "Forgive me. Promise, I will not go away from our home again," he said.​</h2><br />

                            25. geuss the tittle
It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
There's always something that's standing in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no looking back
There ain't no one to prove, we don't got this on lock, yeah
The wait is over
The time is now, so let's do it right
Yeah, we'll keep going
And stay up until we see the sunrise
And we'll say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
No, we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Well, let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive, mmm
'Cause it's not over
Till it's over, say it one more time, say
I wanna dance, the music's got me going (the music's got me going)
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah (hey)
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools (like we're dancing fools)
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

The trouble was it fell on me and I and water dont agree  A lot of christeners stood and listened: I let them know that I was Christened 6.Winter is cold It is Winder Never Hot There are children playing Especially freezing  Really Cold 7."A noiseless patient spider, I mark'd where on a little promontory is stood isolated, Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, It launch'd forth filament,filament,filament, out kf itself  Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them 8.How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's  Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love with a passion put to use  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love these with a love I seem to lose  With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath  Smiles, tears, of all my life!and if God choose I shall but love thee better after death 9. I'm ready to take on a taut strand,but I'd rather take the slack,one,for I could go far that way 10.A touch of cold in the Autumn night I walked abroad, And saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge  Like a Red-faced farmer​ ​</h2><br />

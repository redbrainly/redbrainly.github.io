José Garcia Villa - 1908-199
First, a poem must be magical,
Then musical as a sea-gull.
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird’s flowering.
It must be slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well.
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, like a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem’s cover.

You who have grown so intimate with stars 
And know their silver dripping from your wings, 
Swept with the breaking day across the sky,

You who have touched the rainbow’s fragile gold, 
Carved lyric ways through dawn and dusk and rain 
And soared to heights our hearts have only dreamed—
How can you walk earth’s common ways again?

José Garcia Villa - 1908-199
First, a poem must be magical,
Then musical as a sea-gull.
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird’s flowering.
It must be slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well.
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, like a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem’s cover.

And soared to heights our hearts have only dreamed—
How can you walk earth’s common ways again?

1. Hereza Start is an enrichment program for Grade 11
SHS students. The program’s heads would like to know
the mean intelligence (IQ) of its participants. They know
that IQ has standard deviation of 15 points. They take
a random sample of 20 students and administer IQ
tests. These are the scores:98, 82, 100, 102, 78, 79, 95,
89, 90, 99, 105, 103, 93, 99, 101, 89, 102, 76, 91, 100.
2. Given the following values: ̅ = 110,  = 6,  = 16, μ =
102, and σ = 7
3. Joel administered a mathematics achievement test to a
random sample of 40 Grade 10 students. In this
sample, he obtained the mean and variance to 89 and
81 respectively. The population mean is 85.
4. A random sample of 100 school heads were
administered a Management Skills Test. The sample
mean and the variance were 81 and 26.98. In the
standardization test, the mean was 79 and the standard
deviation was 7.

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2. Why did Megan Reyes choose Silliman University?3. What's her purpose for applying? 4. What other documents are sent together with her letter?​</a>

                                            A researcher conducted a study in Poonbato Integrated School. With a total 
of 4,876, he cannot use all students as his participants due to lack of resources. His 
topic is about the evaluation of the school head’s Sagip Kalinga Program, a program 
focusing on indigenous peoples (IP) parents. Since the school is 100% IP school, any
parent who has a child enrolled in that school is a potential respondent. 
Questions:
1. Which type of research design is the most appropriate in this case? Read the 
topic of the research that was mentioned.
2. Which sampling technique must be used? Remember that all parents who has 
a child enrolled in that school are potential respondents.
3. What is the sample size using Slovin’s formula given a margin of error of 5%?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every day, people are inundated with decisions, big and small. Understanding how people arrive at their choices is an area of cognitive psychology that has received attention. Theories have been generated to explain how people make decisions, and what types of factors influence decision making in the present and future. In addition, heuristics have been researched to understand the decision making process.</p><p></p><p>Several factors influence decision making. These factors, including past experience (Juliusson, Karlsson, &amp; GÓ“rling, 2005), cognitive biases (Stanovich &amp; West, 2008), age and individual differences (Bruin, Parker, &amp; Fischoff, 2007), belief in personal relevance (Acevedo, &amp; Krueger, 2004), and an escalation of commitment, influence what choices people make. Understanding the factors that influence decision making process is important to understanding what decisions are made. That is, the factors that influence the process may impact the outcomes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CARRYONSTUDYING<br />BRAINLIEST THIS ANSWER PLS.</p><br />

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration.

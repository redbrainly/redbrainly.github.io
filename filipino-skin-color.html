                                            Over the past couple of days, I thought long and hard about this question. What does itmean to be Filipino?2 I was born to Filipino parents, raised in Manila and was as “pure” as a Filipino can get;short, morena and a nose just between pointed and flat (because I refuse to accept that Pinoysare pango; we are not). Though from time to time, my mother would bring up her lola was “pure”Spanish and that we had European blood running through our veins, albeit a drop. But I did notthink it mattered, she was after all saying this to a six- or seven-year-old me. It did not matteruntil I was in first grade and the girl I sat next to in class, fair-skinned, ash brown hair with eyesthat disappeared when she smiled, told me she did not want to play with me because my skinlooked “dirty.” 3 I never forgot that. So, whenever I could, I would casually bring up to friends that I wasone fourth or part Spanish. But no one believed me because my features were far from whatanyone would call mestiza.4 For a time, I thought papaya soap would brighten my skin and outlook. Obviously, itdidn’t and was told instead that, like this girl from school who pursued showbiz, I’d need tobleach my skin to get “more opportunities.” My mother would never approve so I resigned to therole given to me: the short morena one.5 I turned my attention to extracurriculars and school (yes, in that order). I learned aboutFilipino history, our heroes, how the Spanish and Japanese raped our country and our women,how the Americans “democratically” took advantage of our naïveté. I memorized the names of thepresidents we’ve had, went on poverty immersions, tutored children from public schools, visitedpolitical prisoners. We watched films that showed us what happened during Martial Law, towhich mom and dad each had their own take on what “really” happened. People Power overthrewthe Marcos administration two decades later and the first female president, Cory Aquino,restored democracy. No one thought another revolution would happen until former presidentJoseph Estrada took office. The action star turned politician would later be removed from his seatof power three days after a peaceful protest and Estrada was found guilty of plunder. “Order” wasrestored.6 Experiencing life in a middle-class Filipino household and learning about our history,however, didn’t fill me with a sense of patriotism or pride. Not when opportunities are based onhow fair the color of your skin is, as if lighter is an indication of better quality. My eyes don’tbrim or fill with tears when I watch historical movies or even the news because too often, they aremelodramatic. Meanwhile, the qualifications we have set for our leaders are far too inadequate,“natural born Filipino; a registered voter; must be able to read and write; 40 years of age at theday of the election.” Elections are won based on popularity, catchy campaign jingles and howmany votes one’s funding can afford.7 Too many times I’ve cringed as the media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with aperson of influence or power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not oncebeen to the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage. It takes validationfrom the West for us to recognize and laud our own—our own born, raised, educated, and trainedhere at home. We are prejudiced against our own brothers and sisters across the archipelago, wecall them names. We call other ethnicities derogatory names “jokingly,” too. Ironically, we areoutraged when our people and culture are depicted in the media inaccurately.8 Do I hate being Filipino? No, hate is a strong word. Do I wish I were born to non-Filipinoparents, not at all. I respect my heritage and the land I grew up in. I respect the wealth of naturalresources we have through responsible tourism and travel. I pay taxes and I do not break thelaw. I respect the brilliant minds working towards positive change whether here or on a globalscale and support their advocacies. But until we cease being slaves to awa or emotions, until westop eschewing education and logic, until the parlor tricks of local politics lose its appeal amongthe masses, until we do our part, and the administration does theirs, until we’ve fully, completelyembraced that brown is a great color…all we have are pieces of our glorious past. And perhapsyan po ung story sariling opinion daw po eto people ung questions1.The Philippine history is a story of a glorious past.2 News and historical movies in the Philippines are often melodramatic.3. The Philippine media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with a person of influenceor power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not once beento the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage4.Filipinos have low standards in choosing leaders. 5.The masses are easily tricked by politicians.6.Filipinos’ brown skin is great​</a>

Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells.Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple winds,Rains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients, for love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness.My duty and destiny are thirty-three million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconuts, throwing nets far into the Pacific.Hacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese, and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of ManFor I am Christian who looks upon all men and womenAs brothers and sisters whose task is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst any injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.Guide Questions:1. Describe the islands in the poem.2. What are the Filipinos doing for a living, according to the poem? Do you  agree? Support your answer.3. What is the ideal which our heroes fought and died for?4. Do you think it is our duty to be proud of being Filipinos? Support your  answer.5. What is the message of the poem?​</a>

                            8. Over the past couple of days, I thought long and hard about this question. What does itmean to be Filipino?2 I was born to Filipino parents, raised in Manila and was as “pure” as a Filipino can get;short, morena and a nose just between pointed and flat (because I refuse to accept that Pinoysare pango; we are not). Though from time to time, my mother would bring up her lola was “pure”Spanish and that we had European blood running through our veins, albeit a drop. But I did notthink it mattered, she was after all saying this to a six- or seven-year-old me. It did not matteruntil I was in first grade and the girl I sat next to in class, fair-skinned, ash brown hair with eyesthat disappeared when she smiled, told me she did not want to play with me because my skinlooked “dirty.” 3 I never forgot that. So, whenever I could, I would casually bring up to friends that I wasone fourth or part Spanish. But no one believed me because my features were far from whatanyone would call mestiza.4 For a time, I thought papaya soap would brighten my skin and outlook. Obviously, itdidn’t and was told instead that, like this girl from school who pursued showbiz, I’d need tobleach my skin to get “more opportunities.” My mother would never approve so I resigned to therole given to me: the short morena one.5 I turned my attention to extracurriculars and school (yes, in that order). I learned aboutFilipino history, our heroes, how the Spanish and Japanese raped our country and our women,how the Americans “democratically” took advantage of our naïveté. I memorized the names of thepresidents we’ve had, went on poverty immersions, tutored children from public schools, visitedpolitical prisoners. We watched films that showed us what happened during Martial Law, towhich mom and dad each had their own take on what “really” happened. People Power overthrewthe Marcos administration two decades later and the first female president, Cory Aquino,restored democracy. No one thought another revolution would happen until former presidentJoseph Estrada took office. The action star turned politician would later be removed from his seatof power three days after a peaceful protest and Estrada was found guilty of plunder. “Order” wasrestored.6 Experiencing life in a middle-class Filipino household and learning about our history,however, didn’t fill me with a sense of patriotism or pride. Not when opportunities are based onhow fair the color of your skin is, as if lighter is an indication of better quality. My eyes don’tbrim or fill with tears when I watch historical movies or even the news because too often, they aremelodramatic. Meanwhile, the qualifications we have set for our leaders are far too inadequate,“natural born Filipino; a registered voter; must be able to read and write; 40 years of age at theday of the election.” Elections are won based on popularity, catchy campaign jingles and howmany votes one’s funding can afford.7 Too many times I’ve cringed as the media too quickly associates Pinoy Pride with aperson of influence or power who has an ounce of Filipino blood in him or her but has not oncebeen to the Philippines or know anything about his or her Filipino heritage. It takes validationfrom the West for us to recognize and laud our own—our own born, raised, educated, and trainedhere at home. We are prejudiced against our own brothers and sisters across the archipelago, wecall them names. We call other ethnicities derogatory names “jokingly,” too. Ironically, we areoutraged when our people and culture are depicted in the media inaccurately.8 Do I hate being Filipino? No, hate is a strong word. Do I wish I were born to non-Filipinoparents, not at all. I respect my heritage and the land I grew up in. I respect the wealth of naturalresources we have through responsible tourism and travel. I pay taxes and I do not break thelaw. I respect the brilliant minds working towards positive change whether here or on a globalscale and support their advocacies. But until we cease being slaves to awa or emotions, until westop eschewing education and logic, until the parlor tricks of local politics lose its appeal amongthe masses, until we do our part, and the administration does theirs, until we’ve fully, completelyembraced that brown is a great color…all we have are pieces of our glorious past. And perhapsyan po ung story sariling opinion daw po eto people ung questions1.The Philippine history is a story of a glorious past.2 News and historical movies in the Philippines are often melodramatic.3.

And yes, I agree with us helping one another and spreading peace all throughout, evil will surely subside.Yes, it is a responsibility, to walk chin up, full of confidence and to proudly say "I am a Filipino", when asked of race, to say that "I am dark-skinned, hardworking, and a <strong>FILIPI</strong><strong>NO</strong>, and I will always be proud of it", to show our appreciation and undying respect of our culture,country,and people.All of it still lives, except the fact that the number of people who willingly show these traits have decreased.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>These answers contain my opinions, so feel free to change them...</p><p></p><p>Please do not that I am not a genius and that my answers are not 100% accurate...</p><p></p><p>#Goodluck!</p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />

Read the poem and answer the following questions.I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia ManoI am a Filipino, I come from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moons and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells.Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple winds,Rains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients, for love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness.My duty and destiny are thirty-three million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconuts, throwing nets far into the Pacific.Hacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese, and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of ManFor I am Christian who looks upon all men and womenAs brothers and sisters whose task is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst any injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.Guide Questions:1.

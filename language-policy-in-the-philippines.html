                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The maintenance of English as an international language for the Philippines and as a non-exclusive language of science and technology.Filipino and English shall be used as media of instruction, the use allocated to specific subjects in the curriculum as indicated in the Department Order No. 25, s. 1974.The regional languages shall be used as auxiliary media of instruction and as the initial language for literacy, where needed.

Filipino and English shall be taught as language subjects at all levels to achieve the goals of bilingual competence.

Since competence in the use of both Filipino and English is one of the goals of the Bilingual Education Policy, continuing improvement in the teaching of both languages, their use as media of instruction and the specification of their functions in Philippine schooling shall be the responsibility of the whole educational system.

Tertiary level institutions shall lead in the continuing intellectualization of Filipino.  The program of intellectualization, however, shall also be pursued in both the elementary and secondary levels.

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports shall cooperate with the National Language Commission which according to the 1987 Constitution, shall be tasked with the further development and enrichment of Filipino.

The Department of Education Culture and Sports shall provide the means by which the language policy can be implemented with the cooperation of government and non-government organizations.

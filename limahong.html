Travis Shutz In late November 1574, the notorious Limahong and his pirates arrived in the vilippine archipelago. Previous studies have focused on their infamous Manila raid Cross- Lamining Ming Chinese and Spanish sources, the present study examines the campaign to ipture them in Pangasinan in 1575, which reveals a temporary tripartite Sino-Spanish-Luzonese ntipiracy alliance that is occluded in contemporary sources. This study highlights global history s olased on transregional linkages as embodied by Limahong's marauding pirates who, as nonstate calctors, precipitated state-to-state contact between South China and the Philippine archipelago but therhose escape in August 1575 unraveled early Sino-Spanish relations. in 1576 a pair of governors general stood at the maritime frontier of two early modern empires. Writing to their respective monarchs about seaborne raiders, Fujian Grand Coordinator Liu Yaohui and Spanish governor general of the Philippines Francisco de Sande left a lasting impact on the history of early Sino-Spanish relations. Given that both Liu and Sande reported through official correspondence, one may safely assume that neither expected a large public audience for his dispatches. Nevertheless, a number of possible factors--including, but not limited to, misreporting by subordinates, imperial perspectives, or a lack of previous historical relations may have influenced how the two reported the events. As a result for over four centuries an incomplete narrativa has persisted about the Pangasinan campaign against the pirates led by Limahong (Lin Feng, Lin-a-fen), following their infamous raid on Manila in late 1874 https://muse.jhu.edu/article/743681​</a>

                            6. s tivity 2: Identify the method of research Limahong's Pirates, Ming Mariners, and Early Sino- Spanish Relations The Pangasinan Campaign of 1575 and Global History from Below 1. Travis Shutz In late November 1574, the notorious Limahong and his pirates arrived in the vilippine archipelago. Previous studies have focused on their infamous Manila raid Cross- Lamining Ming Chinese and Spanish sources, the present study examines the campaign to ipture them in Pangasinan in 1575, which reveals a temporary tripartite Sino-Spanish-Luzonese ntipiracy alliance that is occluded in contemporary sources. This study highlights global history s olased on transregional linkages as embodied by Limahong's marauding pirates who, as nonstate calctors, precipitated state-to-state contact between South China and the Philippine archipelago but therhose escape in August 1575 unraveled early Sino-Spanish relations. in 1576 a pair of governors general stood at the maritime frontier of two early modern empires. Writing to their respective monarchs about seaborne raiders, Fujian Grand Coordinator Liu Yaohui and Spanish governor general of the Philippines Francisco de Sande left a lasting impact on the history of early Sino-Spanish relations. Given that both Liu and Sande reported through official correspondence, one may safely assume that neither expected a large public audience for his dispatches. Nevertheless, a number of possible factors--including, but not limited to, misreporting by subordinates, imperial perspectives, or a lack of previous historical relations may have influenced how the two reported the events. As a result for over four centuries an incomplete narrativa has persisted about the Pangasinan campaign against the pirates led by Limahong (Lin Feng, Lin-a-fen), following their infamous raid on Manila in late 1874 https://muse.jhu.edu/article/743681​</h2><br />

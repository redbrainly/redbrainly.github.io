                        <strong>THE PHILIPPINES IN 19TH CENTURY IN RIZAL CONTEXT</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Filipinos</strong> were subjected to a feudalistic and master-slave relationship by the Spaniards in the nineteenth century. <strong>Filipinos</strong> were divided into three classes during this time: the highest class, which included Spaniards, peninsulars, and friars.

This chapter will examine the shifting economic landscape of the Philippines in the nineteenth century, as well as how these changes influenced the society in which Rizal grew up, matured, and died.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines in the 19th century, especially in Europe and the United States, was a time of great change and innovation. During this time, concepts like industrialism, democracy, and nationalism ushered in a new era in science, technology, economics, and politics, as well as a new era in politics. Men were able to reach new heights of wealth and dignity as a result of these changes. Despite the fact that the Philippines remained mostly medieval in the nineteenth century, several areas showed hints of improvement or transformation. The Indios' historical feudalistic habits of abuse and exploitation shaped its social and economic structure. Discrimination based on race was harsh. The people's needs were not respected by government processes, and intellectual decay prevailed.</p><p></p><p>SOCIAL STRUCTURE The Spanish landholding system imposed on the country by the conquistadores resulted in a primarily feudalistic society in the Philippines. The "master-slave" relationship between the Spaniards and the Filipinos developed an aristocratic society that exploited the populace. The locals were drafted for hard work and the Spaniards demanded all kinds of taxes and tributes. As a result, the poor get poorer and the privileged get richer.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish officials, the peninsulares, and the friars inhabited its peak. The peninsulares, or Spaniards who were born in Spain and settled there, occupied the highest social status and political positions in the country. The second class consisted of insulares, or Spaniards who were born in the Philippines. The Insulares, like the Peninsulares, were able to enjoy the delights of the Philippines. The Creoles, a mix of natives and Spaniards, were the third group. test roles and positions, racial discrimination was rampant.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/6946895</strong></p><p><strong>#LETSSTUDY</strong></p><p></p><br />

He is considered the national hero (Pambansang Bayani) of the Philippines, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.</p><p>He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution broke out; it was inspired by his writings. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually resulted in Philippine independence.</p><p>Rizal is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order, or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero.[9] He wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El filibusterismo (1891), which together are taken as a national epic, in addition to numerous poems and essays.</p><p><strong>-End</strong></p><p></p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Spain of Rizal’s time. The second half of the 19th century – the time when Rizal lived (from 1861 to 1896) – saw Spain experience its continuing decline. A long war of succession in the kingdom after the Napoleonic era had weakened it. Spain was highly dominated by Church influence in government. In other parts of Europe, liberal ideas had led the path toward separating Church and State, though in different forms.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines remained by far Spain’s most durable colony along with Cuba and Puerto Rico, the lonely remnants of Spain’s once vast American empire. Perhaps because of more distant geography, the colonial policies with respect to the Philippines were harsher and more stringent.</p><p></p><p>Along with other Filipino expatriates of the time, Rizal would be vocal in making the case for the reform of Spain’s colonial policies. The ideas of Enlightenment had breezed through Europe the century before, but Spain remained largely less affected by these strong winds of thought.</p><p></p><p>Rizal’s work comes from the influences of the philosophy of Enlightenment. The political and social reforms that he espoused embodies general ideas of tolerance, more liberty and the need for civil government.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><br />

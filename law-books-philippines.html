                        <strong>CYBERCRIME LAW</strong><p>On September 12, 2012, <strong>Republic Act No. 10175</strong>, sometimes referred to as the "<strong>Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012,</strong>" was enacted by the Philippine Congress. This law targets all forms of cybercrime performed against and through computer systems. Rules for international collaboration as well as substantive penal regulations are included.</p><p></p><p><strong>FIRST PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Everyone assumes that cybercrime exclusively refers to the theft of private information. However, in terms of definition, we can state that "Cyber Crime refers to the use of an <strong>electronic device (computer, laptop, etc.) for stealing someone's data</strong> or attempting to harm them via a computer. Additionally, it is an illegal activity that entails a number of problems, including theft and the use of your machine or IP address as a weapon for criminal action.</p><p></p><p><strong>SECOND PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Speaking generally, we may say that there are four main categories of cybercrime. These include c<strong>yber terrorism, hacking, financial, and privacy issues.</strong> They steal money from users or account holders in financial crimes. They also took data from businesses, which might result in financial crimes. Due to them, transactions are also highly risky. Millions and billions of rupees are stolen annually by hackers from businesspeople and the government.</p><p></p><p><strong>THIRD PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Stealing your private information that you do not want made public is considered a privacy offense. Additionally, because of the <strong>exploitation of personal data,</strong> people suffer greatly as a result, and some even end their lives. In order to harm the public or the website owner, hackers willfully deface websites. In addition, they alter or destroy the value of the already-existing websites.</p><p></p><p><strong>FOURTH PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Compared to few years ago, modern-day terrorism has significantly increased. Cyber terrorism, however, is not merely a problem for <strong>terrorists or terrorist groups</strong>. However, it is also considered a kind of cyber terrorism to seriously threaten someone or their property.</p><p>We are not powerless to combat cybercrime on our own. Similarly, we may prevent cybercrimes from occurring by using a little common sense and reasoning.</p><p></p><p><strong>FIFTH PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>As a conclusion, we may state that <strong>cybercrime is a serious offense </strong>against anyone's privacy or property. Additionally, we can prevent cybercrime by adhering to certain fundamental logic and utilizing common sense. Above all, cybercrime is against both the law and human rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about cybercrime law: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22950998?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

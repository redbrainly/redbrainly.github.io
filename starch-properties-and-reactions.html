                        <p><strong>Answer:Starch has a number of properties. Some of these are: (1) a carbohydrate, (2) a polysaccharide, (3) a nonreducing sugar. These properties can be proven by making starch undergo tests and reactions to yield the desired results.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>(1) Starch is a carbohydrate. A general test for proving a substance is a carbohydrate is called the Molisch Test. The test uses alpha-naphthol in alcohol (Molisch reagent) mixed with the test (starch) solution and adding concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) upon inclination of the container. The concentrated H2SO4 dehydrates (via dehydration reaction) monosaccharides to yield furfurals. It also hydrolyzes (via hydrolysis reaction) the glycosidic bonds present in a disaccharide or polypeptide to be converted into monosaccharides. After, they get dehydrated to form what we call an aldehyde/furfural (pentoses) or 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (hexoses) derivatives. Monosaccharide also known as furfural derivatives will then react with 1-naphthol in Molisch reagent through a condensation reaction in order form 2-layered purple/reddish violet shade colored compound for a positive result. Other expected result is a purple ring upon the junction of the two liquids. With starch as the test solution, it yielded the purple compound/ring. Thus, starch is a carbohydrate.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>(2) Starch is a polysaccharide. A general test proving for a substance is a polysaccharide is the Iodine Test. The test uses iodine in KI (iodine dissolved in water in the presence of potassium chloride) mixed with the test (starch) solution. Starch is also composed of a straight chain sub unit which we can call an amylose. Amylose is responsible for the reaction with iodine. This amylose sub unit of starch is observed to be made up of a straight chain of alpha-glucose monomers that are connected by (a 1 4) glycosidic bonds. In the solution, the amylose is expected as a helically coiled structure. When this iodine is added and mixed, the molecules of iodine become trapped or put into one place within the helical structure and form a complex. Iodine can be seen in blue-black in color and will therefore cause a blue-black appearance with starch once amylose is introduced. The color obtained depends upon the length of the unbranched or linear chain available for complex formation. Iodine complexes with starch form a blue-black product. Other polysaccharides may give other colors including blue or red. With starch as the test solution, it gave a blue-black/deep blue color. Thus, starch is a polysaccharide.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>(3) Starch is a nonreducing sugar. A general test for proving a substance is a reducing or nonreducing sugar is the Benedict's Test. The test uses Benedict's solution mixed in the test (starch) solution and boiled for a 2 minutes. The test is based on the reducing properties of sugars which posses a keto or an aldehyde group. The reduction reaction is carried out in weak alkaline conditions in the presence of sodium carbonate. Reducing sugars under alkaline conditions tautomerise and form enediols. Enediols are very powerful reducing agents. They can reduce cupric ions to cuprous form which is the basis of the Benedict’s reaction. The cupric hydroxide formed is not easily soluble. In order to keep the hydroxide in solution, a metal chelator like citrate (or tartrate) is included in the solution. Benedict’s solution contains milder Na2CO3. Cuprous hydroxide, during the process of heating, is converted to red cuprous oxide. Benedict’s solution is composed of copper sulphate solution, which gives a blue colouration. This will react with the electrons(negatively charged particles) from the ketone/aldehyde group of the free reactive carbonyl group on the carbohydrate to form cuprous oxide (a red-brown precipitate). This observed precipitate is formed because of the reduction of the Copper sub 2+ ions to Cu+ ions. In the process, the carbohydrate is oxidized. This only means that the more free carbonyl groups exist, the increase in the amount of precipitate formed. With starch as the test solution, it did not yield red-brown/brick red precipitate and only maintains the blue colored solution. Thus, starch is a non-reducing sugar.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Read more on Brainly.ph - https://brainly.ph/question/1662987#readmore</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            8. give atleast three starch properties and reaction and describe it in one sentence​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Starch has a number of properties. Some of these are: (1) a carbohydrate, (2) a polysaccharide, (3) a nonreducing sugar. These properties can be proven by making starch undergo tests and reactions to yield the desired results.
</p><p>
</p><p>(1) Starch is a carbohydrate. A general test for proving a substance is a carbohydrate is called the Molisch Test. The test uses alpha-naphthol in alcohol (Molisch reagent) mixed with the test (starch) solution and adding concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) upon inclination of the container. The concentrated H2SO4 dehydrates (via dehydration reaction) monosaccharides to yield furfurals. It also hydrolyzes (via hydrolysis reaction) the glycosidic bonds present in a disaccharide or polypeptide to be converted into monosaccharides. After, they get dehydrated to form what we call an aldehyde/furfural (pentoses) or 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (hexoses) derivatives. Monosaccharide also known as furfural derivatives will then react with 1-naphthol in Molisch reagent through a condensation reaction in order form 2-layered purple/reddish violet shade colored compound for a positive result. Other expected result is a purple ring upon the junction of the two liquids. With starch as the test solution, it yielded the purple compound/ring. Thus, starch is a carbohydrate.
</p><p>
</p><p>(2) Starch is a polysaccharide. A general test proving for a substance is a polysaccharide is the Iodine Test. The test uses iodine in KI (iodine dissolved in water in the presence of potassium chloride) mixed with the test (starch) solution. Starch is also composed of a straight chain sub unit which we can call an amylose. Amylose is responsible for the reaction with iodine. This amylose sub unit of starch is observed to be made up of a straight chain of alpha-glucose monomers that are connected by (a 1 4) glycosidic bonds. In the solution, the amylose is expected as a helically coiled structure. When this iodine is added and mixed, the molecules of iodine become trapped or put into one place within the helical structure and form a complex. Iodine can be seen in blue-black in color and will therefore cause a blue-black appearance with starch once amylose is introduced. The color obtained depends upon the length of the unbranched or linear chain available for complex formation. Iodine complexes with starch form a blue-black product. Other polysaccharides may give other colors including blue or red. With starch as the test solution, it gave a blue-black/deep blue color. Thus, starch is a polysaccharide.
</p><p>
</p><p>(3) Starch is a nonreducing sugar. A general test for proving a substance is a reducing or nonreducing sugar is the Benedict's Test. The test uses Benedict's solution mixed in the test (starch) solution and boiled for a 2 minutes. The test is based on the reducing properties of sugars which posses a keto or an aldehyde group. The reduction reaction is carried out in weak alkaline conditions in the presence of sodium carbonate. Reducing sugars under alkaline conditions tautomerise and form enediols. Enediols are very powerful reducing agents. They can reduce cupric ions to cuprous form which is the basis of the Benedict’s reaction. The cupric hydroxide formed is not easily soluble. In order to keep the hydroxide in solution, a metal chelator like citrate (or tartrate) is included in the solution. Benedict’s solution contains milder Na2CO3. Cuprous hydroxide, during the process of heating, is converted to red cuprous oxide. Benedict’s solution is composed of copper sulphate solution, which gives a blue colouration. This will react with the electrons(negatively charged particles) from the ketone/aldehyde group of the free reactive carbonyl group on the carbohydrate to form cuprous oxide (a red-brown precipitate). This observed precipitate is formed because of the reduction of the Copper sub 2+ ions to Cu+ ions. In the process, the carbohydrate is oxidized. This only means that the more free carbonyl groups exist, the increase in the amount of precipitate formed. With starch as the test solution, it did not yield red-brown/brick red precipitate and only maintains the blue colored solution. Thus, starch is a non-reducing sugar.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><strong>VISCOSITY RESISTS THE FLOW AND INCREASE THE THICKNESS AND CONSISTENCY OF THE STARCH</strong>The state of being thick, sticky, and semi-fluid in consistency, due to internal friction.<p></p><p>When the newly gelatin starch is stirred, more swollen granules break and more starch molecules spill causing increase in viscosity or thickness. </p><p></p><p>In science, viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube. This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.
</p><p>
</p><p>A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids. Otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;[2][3] such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid.</p><p></p><p>Viscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate).

                        <p><strong>Starch</strong> has a number of properties. Some of these are: (1) a carbohydrate, (2) a polysaccharide, (3) a nonreducing sugar. These properties can be proven by making starch undergo tests and reactions to yield the desired results.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>(1) Starch is a carbohydrate.</strong> A general test for proving a substance is a carbohydrate is called the Molisch Test. The test uses alpha-naphthol in alcohol (Molisch reagent) mixed with the test (starch) solution and adding concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) upon inclination of the container. The concentrated H2SO4 dehydrates (via dehydration reaction) monosaccharides to yield furfurals. It also hydrolyzes (via hydrolysis reaction) the glycosidic bonds present in a disaccharide or polypeptide to be converted into monosaccharides. After, they get dehydrated to form what we call an aldehyde/furfural (pentoses) or 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (hexoses) derivatives. Monosaccharide also known as furfural derivatives will then react with 1-naphthol in Molisch reagent through a condensation reaction in order form 2-layered purple/reddish violet shade colored compound for a positive result. Other expected result is a purple ring upon the junction of the two liquids. With starch as the test solution, it yielded the purple compound/ring. Thus, starch is a carbohydrate. 
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>(2) Starch is a polysaccharide.</strong> A general test proving for a substance is a polysaccharide is the Iodine Test. The test uses iodine in KI (iodine dissolved in water in the presence of potassium chloride) mixed with the test (starch) solution. Starch is also composed of a straight chain sub unit which we can call an amylose. Amylose is responsible for the reaction with iodine. This amylose sub unit of starch is observed to be made up of a straight chain of alpha-glucose monomers that are connected by (a 1  4) glycosidic bonds. In the solution, the amylose is expected as a helically coiled structure. When this iodine is added and mixed, the molecules of iodine become trapped or put into one place within the helical structure and form a complex. Iodine can be seen in blue-black in color and will therefore cause a blue-black appearance with starch once amylose is introduced. The color obtained depends upon the length of the unbranched or linear chain available for complex formation. Iodine complexes with starch form a blue-black product. Other polysaccharides may give other colors including blue or red. With starch as the test solution,  it gave a blue-black/deep blue color. Thus, starch is a polysaccharide. 
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>(3) Starch is a nonreducing sugar. </strong>A general test for proving a substance is a reducing or nonreducing sugar is the Benedict's Test. The test uses Benedict's solution mixed in the test (starch) solution and boiled for a 2 minutes. The test is based on the reducing properties of sugars which posses a keto or an aldehyde group. The reduction reaction is carried out in weak alkaline conditions in the presence of sodium carbonate. Reducing sugars under alkaline conditions tautomerise and form enediols. Enediols are very powerful reducing agents. They can reduce cupric ions to cuprous form which is the basis of the Benedict’s reaction. The cupric hydroxide formed is not easily soluble. In order to keep the hydroxide in solution, a metal chelator like citrate (or tartrate) is included in the solution. Benedict’s solution contains milder Na2CO3. Cuprous hydroxide, during the process of heating, is converted to red cuprous oxide. Benedict’s solution is composed of copper sulphate solution, which gives a blue colouration. This will react with the electrons(negatively charged particles) from the ketone/aldehyde group of the free reactive carbonyl group on the carbohydrate to form cuprous oxide (a red-brown precipitate). This observed precipitate is formed because of the reduction of the Copper sub 2+ ions to Cu+ ions. In the process, the carbohydrate is oxidized. This only means that the more free carbonyl groups exist, the increase in the amount of precipitate formed. With starch as the test solution, it did not yield red-brown/brick red precipitate and only maintains the blue colored solution. Thus, starch is a non-reducing sugar.

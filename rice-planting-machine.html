                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Machine transplanting</p><p>MachineTransplantingWhat is machine transplanting of rice?</p><p>Machine transplanting involves planting young rice seedlings into puddled soil by a machine.</p><p></p><p>Why machine transplant rice?</p><p>Machine transplanting requires considerably less time and labor than manual transplanting (1–2 ha/person/day versus 0.07 ha/person/day).</p><p></p><p>Advantages: machine transplanting</p><p>Fast and efficient (1–2 ha/d), uses less labor and ensures timely planting.</p><p>Reduces stress, work load, and health risks.</p><p>Ensures uniform spacing and plant density.</p><p>Seedlings recover fast, tiller vigorously, and mature uniformly.</p><p>How to transplant rice by machine?</p><p>Raise seedlings in special mat nurseries or in seedling trays. Use 18–25 kg of good seed per 100 m2 of nursery for each ha.</p><p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 12–15 days after seeding (DAS).</p><p>Ensure that fields are well-puddled and well-leveled.</p><p>Drain fields and allow mud to settle for 1–2 days after the final puddling.</p><p>The subsurface soil layers need to be hard enough to support the transplanting machine.</p><p>The soil is ready when a small “V” mark made in the puddled soil with a stick holds its shape. At this moisture level, the soil can hold the seedlings upright.</p><p>Soil should not be so dry that it sticks to and interferes with planting parts or wheels of the transplanter.</p><p>Load the seedling mats into the machine and transplant the seedlings at the selected machine setting.</p><p>Limitations:</p><p>Seedlings must be planted while still young, and this makes machine transplanting a more suitable method only in irrigated areas.</p><p>Good nursery management practices are required e.g Mat nursery &amp; seedling trays. Special nursery management is needed (mat nursery or seedling trays).</p><p>Proper land preparation, land leveling and water management should be there.</p><p>Fields should be accessible for a smooth entry, exit,and tour of machines.</p><p>Transplanting machines and its maintenance are expensive; so poor farmers cannot afford them (contract hiring of transplanters is available in some countries).</p><p>Problems in poorly prepared and leveled land, or with poorly designed machines.</p><p>Need of training on machine operations makes it time consuming and expensive.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE ITS HELP!</p><p>CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG!</p><br />

                                            EMPHASIS As I go through life, I am aware that there will always be trials and challenges. For a handicapped person like myself, life is almost synonymous with the word struggle. I have to continuously show the world that I can be useful and productive like normal individuals. The success of handicapped people who have helped themselves rests on private and public institutions that are ready and willing to give the disabled a chance to earn living is priceless. We, the disabled are still a part of society and are entitled to the human rights all normal persons enjoy. (Source: "The Bright Side of Darkness "By Carolina G.

I am fascinated by the beauty and the cleanliness of the place. I would also like to eat authentic Japanese foods which I really love eating.  I also want to have the "Sakura experience." I am also curious about the famous mountain in Japan, Mt. Fuji. I also want to meet and discover the culture and tradition of the Japanese people. I would make sure that I have enough money to tour the different famous spots in Japan and stay in nice and fancy hotels. I would go shopping and eat, walk around, and repeat. I would also like to go to their revered temples and wear kimono and have so many pictures taken. Of course, I would love to experience this with my family. This is a very costly dream vacation but who knows, only time will tell if fate will grant me this dream.

                            26. EXPLAIN these in your own words. 1. Globalization affected the proliferation of international terrorism. 2. Globalization led to the turn of religion into public life. 3. Deterritorialization of religion brought about by global migration. 4. Religion as a source of global conflict. 5. Globalization as a spatial phenomenon.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Terrorists successfully exploit the process of globalization and use it to increase their resilience, violent means, and presence globally. Globalization that is highly developed and economic downturn has led to increased violence.</p><p></p><p>2.By diminishing the barriers between different cultures, globalisation lands religion in a quagmire of conflicts which reinforce social identities as some do not accept the new realities and turn to religion to rediscover their own identity. Religion provides a sense of belongingness to a group in the world.</p><p></p><p>3.In the context of globalization studies, deterritorialization means that cultural experience is in various ways lifted out of its traditional anchoring in particular localities. Deterritorialization happens when people migrate and try and establish aspects of their home culture in a new environment.</p><p></p><p>4.Religion is not usually the sole or even primary cause of conflict. ... Religious affiliation and conviction often motivates religious communities to advocate particular peace-related government policies. Religious communities also directly oppose repression and promote peace and reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>5.Globalization and the Spatial Turn</p><p>For, insofar as globalization appears to be an essentially spatial phenomenon, it allegedly demands an approach that is sensitive to issues of space, place, and scale. Moreover, when we approach globalization in such terms, this often changes how other issues are seen.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Pa Brainliest Pls</strong></p><p><strong>Pa Brainliest PlsThank me later</strong></p><p></p><br />

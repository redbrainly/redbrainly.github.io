                                            To Helen by Edgar Allen Poe Analysis "Helen, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore. On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece, And the grandeur that was Rome, Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand, The agate lamp within thy hand, Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!"ACTIVITY Choose two questions from the list and answer. 1. Briefly explain why Poe uses "glory" in reference to Ancient Greece and "grandeur" in reference to ancient Rome. 2. Poe compares Helen to Psyche, beloved of Eros (Cupid) in ancient mythology. Write an essay informing your readers about the myth of Cupid and Psyche. 3. Do archaic or quaint words such as thy, thee, lo and yon enhance the effect of the poem? Explain your answer. 4. How does mythology function in this poem?5. How effectively does the speaker declare his love? Would you be moved if somebody wrote this poem for you? Why? need ko lang po ng sagot​</a>

The CatchI am not really very good at sports but I have played them all my life. When I was ate, I tried to play baseball. I wasn't very good. At that practice I was asigned to right field. That summer I played right field or sat on the bench in every game. We played twelve games and I struck out every time. I struck out again in the top of the ninth inning of our last game, my last at bat that summer. When the other team went into bat, I was playing in night field again. The score was three to two. We were ahead. But if the other team scored two runs, they would win. The first batter got on base with a wak. The second and third batter struck out. The fourth batter hit a double. There were two men on base and two outs. When the next batter was up, I prayed that he wouldn't hit it to me. Then I saw my dad smiling at me. I heard the bat crack and then my dad yelling, "Look up!" I saw the ball coming at me. I reached my globe up and closed my eyes. I opened my glove and the ball landed in it. We won! Eviyone patted me on the back and gave me high fives but I just wanted to see my dad. Then I saw my dad smyle with pride. We didn't talk on the drive home. Instead, we just looked at the game ball and held each other's hands.CORRECT SPELLING 11._______________12._______________13._______________14._______________15._______________​</a>

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

What did you feel after reading the story? "As a university professor, the challenges of moving to virtual classes were not far behind. Even though I had just received a certification in virtual distance education. During this semester, I found myself teaching a course on contemporary models of psychotherapy. Two weeks after the quarantine began, the unit I would teach on would be expressive therapies. I was thinking how to translate a dynamic application in the classroom into a virtual activity. At that moment it occurred to me, rather than giving a class, my students needed that space to process the new reality of COVID-19. So, not only did I give a virtual class on expressive therapies, I converted the space into an art therapy live application as well. The goal was that each of them from their homes could express themselves from their homes through four drawings, allowing creativity to flow and emphasizing the process, not the result. By discussing the theories, they analyzed their arts meaning, which in turn promoted laughter and participation among them. Also, the group discussions allowed them to find new meanings, named their concerns and see the positive side of it all. But more importantly, it 15​</a>

The CatchI am not really very good at sports but I have played them all my life. When I was ate, I tried to play baseball. I wasn't very good. At that practice I was asigned to right field. That summer I played right field or sat on the bench in every game. We played twelve games and I struck out every time. I struck out again in the top of the ninth inning of our last game, my last at bat that summer. When the other team went into bat, I was playing in night field again. The score was three to two. We were ahead. But if the other team scored two runs, they would win. The first batter got on base with a wak. The second and third batter struck out. The fourth batter hit a double. There were two men on base and two outs. When the next batter was up, I prayed that he wouldn't hit it to me. Then I saw my dad smiling at me. I heard the bat crack and then my dad yelling, "Look up!" I saw the ball coming at me. I reached my globe up and closed my eyes. I opened my glove and the ball landed in it. We won! Eviyone patted me on the back and gave me high fives but I just wanted to see my dad. Then I saw my dad smyle with pride. We didn't talk on the drive home. Instead, we just looked at the game ball and held each other's hands.CORRECT SPELLING 11._______________12._______________13._______________14._______________15._______________​</h2><br />

Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Piano is a one of the most wonderful instrument that you will ever have. The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy. Cristofori was unsatisfied by the lack of control that musicians had over the volume level of the harpsichord. He is credited for switching out the plucking mechanism with a hammer to create the modern piano in around the year 1700. And piano has a graceful sound, that you can press the keys with your finger. And you can learn it by practicing some of the simple notes. And for me, I think piano was the most great instrument that I held. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoons are truly one of the most devastating natural disasters on our planet. Although, it is also the only forecasted, meaning, we already know how strong it is and when it is going to make landfall, but, the devastating damages it brings is still unprecedented and are unable to predict as of speaking. We should never undermine a typhoon whether it is forecasted to have a minimum wind speed of 85kph or gustiness of 90kph, no matter how weak the numbers shows, the damages it will bring in never equal to it. Outmost preparations are still needed and being complacent should not be the attitude. Preparation saves lives and infrastructures.

                        <strong>“This Is Me” — Keala Settle</strong><p></p><p><strong>Media information </strong>and problems with body image are closely related. Social media has, on the one hand, created many new opportunities for networking, but it has also increased the pressure to appear good, have a lot of likes, and receive favorable feedback across a variety of platforms. The mental health of many young people may be impacted by this. It has almost become an addiction to receive validation from the internet community. </p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, <strong>media information</strong> may have a negative impact on a person's mental and self-perception. This results from us comparing our actual appearance to idealized photos posted on social media. This might then cause us to feel bad about how we look and how we think of ourselves.

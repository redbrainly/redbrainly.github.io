Sentences are organized in a logical order from beginning to end. Nonverbal communication, on the other hand, has no clear beginning or end, making it continuous.In most cases, verbal communication is undertaken consciously as people think before communicating. Nonverbal communication, on the other hand, occurs unconsciously as people express their emotions and react to certain situations.Verbal communication is usually understood by people who speak a specific language. In contrast, some nonverbal communication can be understood globally.The message can be easily delivered and understood in verbal communication.

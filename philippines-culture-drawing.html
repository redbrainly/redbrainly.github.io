                        1. The analysis of the above description of Antonio de Morga about the early inhabitants<p>I <strong>disagree</strong> that the Filipino people attacked other tribes and settlements, killed people, and committed numerous other atrocities before the Spanish colonization. Although this is always attempted through legal or illegal means, depending on the opportunity and necessity, it is impossible to stop them. The custom of giving young girls to these men and paying them to seduce them was also prevalent, as the people thought it was unlucky and uncouth if the females were virgins when they got married.</p><p></p>1. The characteristics of culture and practices of the early Filipinos still exist nowadays<p><strong>Yes</strong>, some of the recognized traits of the early Filipinos' culture and behaviors can still be found today. Examples of this include the following:</p>Before the arrival of the British, Filipinos were big consumers of imported goods, particularly Chinese silk and diamonds. Despite this, contemporary Filipinos still purchase<strong> products made in China.</strong>Filipinos today enjoy <strong>karaoke</strong> just as much as they did at pre-colonial community bonfires when stories were best told via song.Both Zarzuelas and Moro-Moros were popular in the colonial Philippines. Filipinos today like watching soap operas and <strong>telenovelas</strong>.<p></p>Further explanation:What do you believe the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio de Morga means?<p>The Sucesos is the product of an objective observer who was also a significant player in the drama of his era and a dynamic bureaucrat who was well familiar with how the government operated. In contrast to the religious chroniclers, it is also the<strong> first history of the Spanish Philippines </strong>to be written by a layperson.</p><p></p><p>There are free access online archives on Filipino history and culture in the age of the Internet, such as the sizable digital <strong>Filipiniana collection of the University of Michigan</strong>, which includes documents and images from the Philippines in the early 20th century. The University of Illinois at Chicago Field Museum is another excellent online repository for primary documents. Dean Worcester, the interior secretary of the American colonial government in the nation from 1901 to 1913, had a sizable photography collection there.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Spanish colonization here: https://brainly.ph/question/2487699#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Filipino national costume is rather colorful, ornate, and beautiful.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(2) Filipino older adults tend to cope with illness with the help of family and friends, and by faith in God. Complete cure or even the slightest improvement in a malady or illness is viewed as a miracle. Filipino families greatly influence patients’ decisions about health care. Patients subjugate personal needs and tend to go along with the demands of a more authoritative family figure in order to maintain group harmony. Before seeking professional help, Filipino older adults tend to manage their illnesses by self-monitoring of symptoms, ascertaining possible causes, determining the severity and threat to functional capacity, and considering the financial and emotional burden to the family.</p><br />

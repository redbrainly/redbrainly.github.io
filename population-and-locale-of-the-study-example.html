                                            The organisms of the same kind, we call it species that live in the same area make up a population. Like when individual person lives in the same location or area, they make up the human population of that area, and if a certain species of fish like milkfish or locally known as “Bangus”, are living in the same area, they comprise the milkfish population. The entire array populations that live in the same location make up a community. The community consists of different populations of organism living in the same area. For example, the Laguna Lake caters to different kinds of living things like fishes, water plants and grasses. All of these organisms comprise the community of living things in the lake. When the community interacts with its physical environment which includes water, air, sunlight, soil, rock and minerals. This brings us to the next level of organization called ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a given area together with the nonliving things. The Laguna Lake is an example of an ecosystem. A group of similar ecosystems with the same type of physical environment is called a biome. Many different biomes consist our biosphere. The biosphere is the part of our planet where all life exists including all of the environments on Earth that support life. These include regions of land, bodies of water and the lower portion of the atmosphere. , D Learning Task 1 : Study the given diagram. Complete it using the different terms presented inside the box.

Try to DEDUCE andformulate its Research topic.Massachusetts provides good opportunities for historic population research, sinceregistration of births, deaths, and marriages was made compulsory in 1639 (Spiegelman,1968:3). Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

Damage natural habitats and/or kill plants and animals. Rice fields are turned into residential or commercial centers. People cut too many trees for lumber or paper or building houses. More factories are being built to keep up with the demands of a fast growing population and industrialization. Too much mining and quarrying for the purpose of getting precious metals and stones and gravel. Some farmers use too much chemical fertilizers to replenish soil fertility. Plastics and other garbage are burned. Cars, trucks, and tricycles that emit dark smoke (smoke belchers) are allowed to travel. Other activities. (Give other human activities) Too much fertilizer destroys the quality of the soil and is harmful to both human and animals. 2. Discuss the effects of these activities on natural resources. 3.

                            7. The organisms of the same kind, we call it species that live in the same area make up a population. Like when individual person lives in the same location or area, they make up the human population of that area, and if a certain species of fish like milkfish or locally known as “Bangus”, are living in the same area, they comprise the milkfish population. The entire array populations that live in the same location make up a community. The community consists of different populations of organism living in the same area. For example, the Laguna Lake caters to different kinds of living things like fishes, water plants and grasses. All of these organisms comprise the community of living things in the lake. When the community interacts with its physical environment which includes water, air, sunlight, soil, rock and minerals. This brings us to the next level of organization called ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a given area together with the nonliving things. The Laguna Lake is an example of an ecosystem. A group of similar ecosystems with the same type of physical environment is called a biome. Many different biomes consist our biosphere. The biosphere is the part of our planet where all life exists including all of the environments on Earth that support life. These include regions of land, bodies of water and the lower portion of the atmosphere. , D Learning Task 1 : Study the given diagram. Complete it using the different terms presented inside the box.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wildlife Populations
</p><p>Populations are all the members of a species that live in a one area. You are part of the human population for your home town. A freshwater pond has multiple populations, including a population of mallard ducks, and a population of cattail plants growing on the edge.
</p><p>
</p><p>All of the populations that live and interact with each other in one area make of the community of that area. Our freshwater pond community includes the mallard ducks, the cattail plants, the fish in the pond, and many other species.
</p><p>
</p><p>The populations and community are affected by many non-living factors in the area, such as the water of the pond, the amount of sunlight, the different nutrients of the soil, and even the quality of the air. All these living and non-living components form the ecosystem of freshwater pond.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ducks on a river
</p><p>The interactions of an ecosystem are often described as webs that show how the pieces are interrelated. An example of a generic food web in an ecosystem is shown below. All the species connect in multiple interactions, and are dependent on each other.
</p><p>
</p><p>ecosystem diagram
</p><p>For the ecosystem to be healthy, every part of that ecosystem must be healthy too. Likewise, to protect an ecosystem, every part, from soil to water to prey animals to predators, must be protected.
</p><p>
</p><p>If one piece of the web is damaged, everything it interacts with will be affected. It is this interrelatedness that explains why losing one species can lead to the loss of other species.
</p><p>
</p><p>When ecosystems become unbalance, whole populations of animals are more susceptible to diseases or other disturbances. The health of ecosystems is a delicate balance of plant, animal, environment, and human interaction.
</p><p>
</p><p>Human activities are one of the biggest influences on ecosystems and the populations in them. The graph below shows the decline in the American Woodcock populations in every state except Illinois. Woodcocks live in forest ecosystems, and human population growth has caused a decrease in forest size as more land is developed for human homes, agriculture, and industry. The growing human population has caused many wildlife populations like the woodcock populations to decrease in size.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>BRAINLIEST ME PLS #KEEPONLEARNING AND #LEARNINGNEVERSTOP</p><br />

Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

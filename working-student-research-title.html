Kind : _____________________________________________3. Strength : _____________________________________________4. Weakness : _____________________________________________5. Importance : _____________________________________________Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</a>

The main objective is to know what is the meaning of working while studying for postgraduate students at IIUM. Four  research  questions were formulated: (1) What  are  postgraduate students’  perceptions  of  working while  studying? (2) What are the positive and negative effects of working while studying? (3) What are the challenges faced by postgraduate students when working while studying and how do they overcome the problems? (4) What are suggestions and  recommendations  for  students  who  are  working  while  studying?  Two informants were purposively selected and interviewed to collect the data. The result shows  that  postgraduate students  understand the  meaning  of working while  studying  and  how  to  deal  with  them  in  term  of  overcoming  the challenges. The recommendations include postgraduate students who decide to  work  while  studying  should  have  good  time  management,  be  committed, disciplined and responsible for what they are doing</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Overall, the flipped classroom had a moderate positive effect (g = . 50) on student performance. The flipped classroom was beneficial regardless of discipline, with effect sizes ranging from weak (i.e., for IT, g = 0.30; k = 14) to strong (i.e., for humanities, g = 0.98; k = 34).</p><p>2.Study habits are the most important predictor of academic performance and global research has revealed that study habits affect academic performance. In other words, students with better academic achievement use these skills more than those with lower academic achievement.</p><p>3.Sleep disruption severely impairs learning ability, affecting academic performance in students.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because some students have difficulties reading or pronouncing a word, they also have difficulty recalling names of characters or certain parts of the novel, and this upsets some students, researchers are conducting a study on reading comprehension in grade 12 pupils. It's also possible that you've lost your focus.</p><p></p><p>I noticed something from some of the readers. They simply read without comprehending even a single word.

This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</h2><br />

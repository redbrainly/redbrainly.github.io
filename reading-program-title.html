</strong>1. I saw something like this in books especially about being prepared for possible calamities. One of the news articles I have read before is about a typhoon where it cost so much lives. What I know is that being prepared is the key to safety. If we are prepared, then we could save more lives. We can watch and read weather forecasts to stay updated.

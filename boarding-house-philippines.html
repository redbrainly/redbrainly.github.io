My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare

could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos

                                            "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."Read the statements below.

                                            Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and

and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary

began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who

                            20. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."Read the statements below.

                            25. Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</h2><br />

How did his story affect your personal views about your studies andyour dreams?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the
</p><p>questions that follow. Do this in your notebook
</p><p>"I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher
</p><p>in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler
</p><p>My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare
</p><p>rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and
</p><p>during my early youth, my father saved as much as he
</p><p>could from his meager salary and from what he could
</p><p>get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos
</p><p>with which to give me an education. During those
</p><p>Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small
</p><p>town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus,
</p><p>did my family live for years. When I was at the age of
</p><p>five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father
</p><p>and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary
</p><p>instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and
</p><p>began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived
</p><p>in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one
</p><p>priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved
</p><p>me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.
</p><p>The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who
</p><p>could only use
</p><p>use his own feet as a means of transportation. My
</p><p>classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very
</p><p>early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the
</p><p>following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an
</p><p>intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest
</p><p>honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my
</p><p>education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my
</p><p>studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came
</p><p>to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had
</p><p>become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a
</p><p>lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me
</p><p>as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board
</p><p>and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

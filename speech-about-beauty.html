Who do you think would benefit from these speeches in particular? Be able to explain your answer.1.All of those nights we spent cramming for the test the next morning, all of the books we read and the essays we wrote, all of the lessons we learned from not only our teachers, but our friends as well, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrrible experiences we have had throughout high school and the other years we spent in K-12 education have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast.2.No man is an island. Everyone needs someone to depend on. Nobody can live without the help of each other. Be good and be friendly.3.Life is beautiful. Sulking will not do you good. It would just make you sad. Go out and explore the beauty of surroundings. Again, life is beautiful to waste it crying over unimportant things.4.Supressing your anger is not good for any person. It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it.

                            1. Informative speech 2 pharagraph about beauty or life or any topic </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beauty is a highly subjective concept that can be difficult to define. However, most people would agree that it refers to qualities that are pleasing or attractive to the senses. Beauty is often associated with features such as symmetry, balance, and proportion, as well as qualities like kindness, compassion, and grace. In many cultures, beauty is also linked to cultural ideals and standards, which can vary widely.</p><p></p><p>One interesting aspect of beauty is that it is often closely tied to our emotions. When we see something that we find beautiful, we may feel a sense of joy or peace. This emotional response to beauty may be hardwired into our brains, as research has shown that the areas of the brain responsible for emotion and pleasure are activated when we experience beauty. Ultimately, beauty is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and what one person finds beautiful may be completely different from what another person finds attractive.</p><p></p><br />

It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it. This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</h2><br />

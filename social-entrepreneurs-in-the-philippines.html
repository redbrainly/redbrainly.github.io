Not only is poverty high when benchmarked against countries in Asia, but also the rate of poverty reduction has been slow. While the Philippine economy has grown at an average of 6 percent for the last five consecutive quarters (since 2012), poverty incidence remains above 20 percent of the population. The critical challenge is to spread the payback of this huge economic turnaround among the people, especially the poorest of the poor. They should feel the benefits of the growing Philippine economy. In this portion of the unit, you will be required to demonstrate your depth understanding on the importance of entrepreneurship and the growing economy of the Philippines. What is the task? Hypothetically speaking, If you were the president of the Philippines what have you envision with our government, economy and to your people? As a political and economic leader, what are your moves/plans to accelerate the economic development and that muster social reforms through entrepreneurship  (1)You have to create an Economic Development Plan for your country. (2) Discuss the benefit it could give to your government, to the economy and specifically to your people.  To counter the challenges that the country is facing specifically in terms of economy, remember Entrepreneurs have the power to achieve great things. More so, Entrepreneurs will emerge as the well-oiled wheels that will keep the economy going and the society efficiently running. (3) Make a realistic Economic Development Plan​</a>

                        Technopreneurs, Social Entrepreneurs, Intrapreneurs, and Extrapreneur In The Philippines<p>The <strong>social entrepreneur </strong>will be the area of specialization that rules the Philippine market. Because a social entrepreneur creates organizations that are either established up as for-profit corporations or as not-for-profit corporations, much like a business entrepreneur. According to the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, they propel social innovation and transformation in a number of industries, including education, health, the environment, and business development. They have the power to ameliorate societal issues in our nation. Although it could be a drawback for some, social entrepreneurs benefit from it because of the additional opportunities it presents.</p><p></p><p>The next type of entrepreneur is an <strong>extrapreneur</strong>, a hybrid of an intrapreneur and an entrepreneur. According to Kristof de Wulf, extrapreneurs are people outside the firm who care about the brand so much that they impulsively engage in entrepreneurial activities for it. Extrapreneurs are those that think creatively or innovatively, which means they do not simply concentrate on internal organizations while seeking for solutions to their challenges, but also conduct an extra study in other businesses. The next person is the <strong>intrapreneur</strong>, who, in accordance with Murray Newlands, is a member of a business that takes risks in an effort to address a specific issue.</p><p></p><p>They play a significant role in raising productivity within businesses. Making decisions for the organization and the business is very difficult and dangerous. Creativity and productivity come naturally to intrapreneurs. Their contributions to a company's ideas are quite beneficial and can assist the enterprise's success. The Technopreneurs come last. According to Universiti Kuala Lumpur, <strong>technopreneurs</strong> are business owners whose primary enterprises involve sectors with a focus on technology. According to US Legal Inc., these people are known as "new age entrepreneurs" because they employ technology to develop fresh, cutting-edge items that they can sell to consumers and profit from. In the same way that their products benefit people by raising their standard of living, businesses generate money as they create new or inventive products.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about entrepreneurs here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/16982992#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            10. “IF I WERE”. Addressing widespread poverty is the single most important policy challenge facing the Philippines. Not only is poverty high when benchmarked against countries in Asia, but also the rate of poverty reduction has been slow. While the Philippine economy has grown at an average of 6 percent for the last five consecutive quarters (since 2012), poverty incidence remains above 20 percent of the population. The critical challenge is to spread the payback of this huge economic turnaround among the people, especially the poorest of the poor. They should feel the benefits of the growing Philippine economy. In this portion of the unit, you will be required to demonstrate your depth understanding on the importance of entrepreneurship and the growing economy of the Philippines. What is the task?

There are clear signs of rebounds in domestic activity, community mobility, industrial output, and recently with bank lending activities. However, there are challenges to growth with the continuing threat of the pandemic amid narrowing policy space. The key policy challenges are to protect long term fiscal sustainability, leverage the private sector in the recovery, and limit the economic scarring from the pandemic.<br />

                            11. JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYMY REFLECTION: 'I believe', 'I think', 'In my opinion', 'My first reaction was', 'I was especially moved by', 'The author was successful in making me feel',JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYPhilippine Daily Inquirer7 Mar 2022the age of COVID-19, Jordanian mechanical engineer Saliba Taimeh pondered how to deal with one contaminated everyday surface: the handrails of escalators in shopping malls and transport hubs.He came up with a device to sterilize them with ultraviolet rays—and this is where TechWorks stepped in.A wealth of ideas would not have seen the light of day without TechWorks, a Jordanian platform aimed at bringing together youth, ideas and resources to jump-start innovations.Set up in 2018, TechWorks says its mission is “to plug into entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems” and turn ideas into reality.It is equipped with stateof-the-art technology such as three-dimensional (3D) printers and affiliated with a foundation set up by Crown Prince of Jordan Hussein bin Abdullah.Last year, it attracted about 100 inventors and start-up companies, enabling them to produce prototypes quickly and at low cost.Taimeh, 39, said TechWorks “provided me with every support, back up, advice and guidance” to help perfect the sterilizing device, after 23 attempts over almost two years.German investorHis invention sterilises the handrails of escalators “from all kinds of viruses, such as coronavirus and bacteria,” he said.After contacting several international companies, a German firm specializing in health and safety in public places signed up to manufacture the “Brigid Box.”Weighing in at 7.2 kilograms (almost 16 pounds), it can be installed in less than 15 minutes.Taimeh’s success story is only one of many.High school student Zain Abu Rumman, 18, has developed a tracking device for elderly patients and people with special needs, worn like a watch or around the neck.The “SPS Watch” has a battery that lasts eight days and is resistant to water, heat and breakage.“The device can send alerts to the mobile phone of a family member through a special application in case the person wearing it falls or is hurt, or if he strays from a certain place,” Abu Rumman said.It took him two-and-a-half years to perfect and he has struck a production accord with a Chinese company.Omar Khader, 26, works for “Jazri Studio,” an industrial design company which has devised a “smart” plug to protect children from electric shocks.“TechWorks has advanced equipment, engineers and technicians that help us convert our ideas into successful products,” he said.Other designers, like 32-yearold civil engineer Malik Nour, still have a long and expensive way to go to refine their products.Nour’s brainchild is the “Pikler Triangle,” designed as a safe and environmentally friendly children’s toy.He hopes to attract Swedish furniture giant IKEA to take on his products, which he is already selling over social media to customers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the label of “Fares World,” named after his child..Creative environmentIsmail Hakki, executive director of TechWorks, said its aim is to provide “a creative environment and all the necessary resources to support and enable young people to transform their projects from a mere idea into a real product.”The doors of the project’s “Fabrication Lab,” or FabLab, are “open to all; we support students, entrepreneurs, and startups,” he said.FabLab also provides services to doctors and hospitals in the fields of facial restoration, digital dentistry, face masks and sterilization.At the request of a doctor, it transformed the chest x-ray of a patient with a malignant tumor close to the heart into a 3D model of the patient’s chest making it easier to operate.FabLab touts many successes, including a “smart home” which allows a mobile phone user to control electrical appliances inside the house from afar by turning on heating or cooling systems and a piano keyboard to help a blind musician play.It plans to open two more branches in Jordan to provide technology training and help for school and university students.​</h2><br />

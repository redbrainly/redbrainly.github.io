                                            1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</a>

Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</h2><br />

No, because the children have learn a lesson from their parents to apply it to theirselves. It is superveneficial especially to children who are not provided a proper care. I agree whit the author because addressing malnutrition and knowing the cause will help governme t to take action<p></p><br />

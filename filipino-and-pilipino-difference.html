Mas matututo ang mga kabataan mahalin ang sariling wika, instead of learning english and other languages. Also, minamaliit kasi natin ang ating wika, at mas pinipiling gamitin ang wikang ingles sa kadahilanang mas cool at mas sosyal itong pakinggan. Isang halimbawa nito ay sa engineering courses. Usually, english terms ang ginagamit namin, subalit dapat ay alam pa din namin ang translasyon nito sa wikang Filipino.

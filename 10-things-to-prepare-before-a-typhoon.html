It is developed fromthe 2.since Philippines is surrounded with water. In simple terms, a tropical cyclone issystem of3.that are moving around the center. It is classified into fourcategories: 4.(64 kph), 5.(118 kph), 6.(200ph), and 7.(&gt;200 kph). As the winds intensify or weaken, the category isupgraded or downgraded accordingly.When a weather disturbance enters the 8.the weather bureau begins tomonitor it. One thing about the tropical cyclone that we should watch out for is the strong winds. At theof the tropical cyclone the wind speed is low. But in the dense cloud surrounding it, at the10.the wind speed is great.When a tropical cyclone is on its way toward the land, public storm warning signals (PSWS) are issuedby 11.to warn people about the approaching weather disturbance. A 12.isannounced if a tropical cyclone has maximum winds of 30-60 kph which can be expected within 36hours. A tropical cyclone is upgraded to PSWS #2 if the winds are greater than 13.and maybe expected within 24 hours. When the tropical cyclone reaches a wind speed of 14.thesignal is raised to PSWS #3. If the tropical cyclone intensified, 15.is released by PAGASAwith very strong winds of more than 185 kph.To be fully prepared for tropical cyclones, you should develop safety habits before, during and afterthe tropical cyclone.LPAPARPAGASAPSWS #1PSWS#460-100 kphthunderstorms100-185 kpheyetyphoonTropical depressioneyewalltropical stormsuper typhoonoceanFrontclimateweathermeteorologyPHILVOCS​</a>

It is classified into fourcategories: 4.(64 kph), 5.(118 kph), 6.(200ph), and 7.(&gt;200 kph). As the winds intensify or weaken, the category isupgraded or downgraded accordingly.When a weather disturbance enters the 8.the weather bureau begins tomonitor it. One thing about the tropical cyclone that we should watch out for is the strong winds. At theof the tropical cyclone the wind speed is low. But in the dense cloud surrounding it, at the10.the wind speed is great.When a tropical cyclone is on its way toward the land, public storm warning signals (PSWS) are issuedby 11.to warn people about the approaching weather disturbance. A 12.isannounced if a tropical cyclone has maximum winds of 30-60 kph which can be expected within 36hours. A tropical cyclone is upgraded to PSWS #2 if the winds are greater than 13.and maybe expected within 24 hours. When the tropical cyclone reaches a wind speed of 14.thesignal is raised to PSWS #3. If the tropical cyclone intensified, 15.is released by PAGASAwith very strong winds of more than 185 kph.To be fully prepared for tropical cyclones, you should develop safety habits before, during and afterthe tropical cyclone.LPAPARPAGASAPSWS #1PSWS#460-100 kphthunderstorms100-185 kpheyetyphoonTropical depressioneyewalltropical stormsuper typhoonoceanFrontclimateweathermeteorologyPHILVOCS​</h2><br />

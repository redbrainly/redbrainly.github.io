There has been a surge in research on how to strengthen or weaken the resilience of diverse systems, whether they be landscapes, coastal areas, or cities. However, the plethora of potential resilience variables has resulted in a somewhat dispersed and fragmented understanding of what is necessary for resilience development and how this knowledge might be used.</p><p></p><p>They present a set of seven principles that are considered crucial for building resilience in social-ecological systems and discuss how these principles can be practically applied. The seven principles are </p>maintain diversity and redundancy, manage connectivity, manage slow variables and feedbacks, foster complex adaptive systems thinking, encourage learning, broaden participation, and promote polycentric governance systems.<p></p>Maintain diversity and redundancy<p></p><p>Systems having a large number of diverse components (for example, species, actors, or sources of knowledge) are more resilient than systems with a small number of components. By allowing certain components to compensate for the loss or failure of others, redundancy provides 'insurance' within a system. When the components that provide redundancy also react differently to change and disturbance, redundancy becomes even more beneficial (response diversity).</p><p></p>Manage connectivity<p>Connectivity has both positive and negative aspects. High levels of connectedness can help with recovery after a disturbance, but they can also propagate disturbances more quickly.</p><p></p>Manage slow variables and feedbacks<p>In many cases, social-ecological systems can be "configured" in a variety of ways. In other words, there are a variety of ways to link and interact with all of the variables in a system, and these diverse configurations give distinct ecosystem services.</p>Foster complex adaptive systems thinking<p>We need to comprehend the intricate interactions and dynamics that exist between actors and ecosystems in a social-ecological system if we are to continue to benefit from a variety of eco-system services.</p>Encourage learning<p>In social-ecological systems, learning and experimenting through adaptive and collaborative management is a key strategy for creating resilience. It guarantees that many types and sources of knowledge are respected and taken into account when producing solutions, and it encourages people to experiment and take risks.</p><p></p>Broaden participation<p>Participation that is broad and well-functioning can help to foster trust, create a shared knowledge, and unearth perspectives that might otherwise be unavailable through more traditional scientific methods.</p><p></p>Promote polycentric governance systems<p>Collaboration between institutions and scales increases learning and connectedness across scales and cultures. Because they are handled by the right people at the right time, well-connected governance systems can quickly deal with change and disruption.</p><p></p>Reymark R.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Galangin po ang ating principles </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>7 Environmental Principles<strong>1.) Nature knows best.</strong><p>This is the most basic principle of all the principles featured in this blog. We humans have to understand nature and follow its rules, because if we want to ensure a continuous and steady supply of resources, one must not go against natural processes. If we, humans, caused any disruption in the cycle of nature, this can bring imbalance to our ecosystem.</p><p></p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>All </strong><strong>forms of life are important</strong><p>Each organism plays a fundamental role in nature. It is easy to appreciate the beautiful organisms like butterflies, especially if one knows their important role in pollination. The giant ones like elephants, the whales, the alligators – are the ones we respect mixed with fear or wonder and the products they produce. But when it comes to unlovely, squirmy, and troublesome creatures, this principle is unusually overlooked.</p><p></p><strong>3.) Everything is connected to everything else</strong><p>In an ecosystem, all biotic and abiotic components interact with each other to ensure that the system is sustained. Any intrusion from outside may cause an imbalance and collapsing of the system.</p><p></p><strong>4.) Everything changes</strong><p>The environment is constantly changing. Organisms also develop through time. However, with our current technology, we have affected these natural changes that these changes now causes problematic events to us. Humans should rethink their relationship with the environment. Because what we believe that is beneficial to the environment often turn out to be catastrophic.</p><p></p><strong>5.) Everything must go </strong><strong>somewhere</strong><p>Everything ends up elsewhere. It doesn’t just disappear. For example, if you throw a piece of candy wrapper away, it disappears from sight but does not cease to exist. It ends up elsewhere. Gases released in the atmosphere may spread but it will end up a component of the atmosphere and can be brought down by rains. Any particular type of waste should always be a concern to us. It may be a pollutant or a resource depending on certain factors. Be a responsible person and throw your trash in a proper place.</p><p></p><strong>6.) Ours is a finite earth</strong><p>Earth’s resources can be classified as either renewable or non-renewable. Renewable resources are those that can be easily replenished by natural cycles (e.g. water, air, plants, animals) while non-renewable resources are those that cannot be replenished through natural cycles. Although renewable resources can be replenished, it is important to understand that these are renewable only if they are not overused and not destroyed from factors such as pollution.</p><p></p><strong>7.) Nature is beautiful and we are stewards of God’s creation!</strong><p>Among all creatures, humans are the only ones made in God’s image and have been given the right to have dominion over all His creations. Being the most intelligent and gifted with reason, humans are capable of manipulating creation to their own advantage. Yet, creation exists not to be ravaged or abused but to be taken care of. Humans cannot exist without nature. They are co-natural with the environment they live in. If the environment they live in is destroyed, with it will go Homo Sapiens.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

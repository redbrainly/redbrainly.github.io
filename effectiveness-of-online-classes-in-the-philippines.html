sentence that presents contrasting ideas.
For several months now, our government together with the rest of the world, has
been planning counter-measures in defeating the
 unseen threat. However, our country
and the world at large are still in dilemma brought about by this Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Philippines, this health crisis has resulted to a major transition especially in
the field of education. One notable effect of this crisis is the adoption of different learning
modalities suited to the context of the school. Similarly, this crisis has caused the public
to express various opinions. Some expressed their disapproval to the new manner of
learning and claimed that many Filipinos are not yet ready to the newly-introduced
modalities such as online classes and blended learning. For them, effective learning
requires real interaction among the teachers and learners. In contrast to this, a certain
author asserted that face-to face learning is NOT necessary in the teaching and learning
process.</a>

                        <p><strong>I </strong><strong>think </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>effect </strong><strong>of online learning to different social classes</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> changes the way that students of all types and ages interact with and access information. Its effect depends both on the student and the institution making the change. A well-developed online course, just like a well-developed traditional course, can open up new worlds of learning for students.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Online learning increases access to education for many different types of people. For those with time-consuming daily obligations, the flexibility of an online course, or even an online degree, can mean the difference between getting a high school degree and a college degree, or an undergraduate degree and a doctorate. In rural areas where resources may be tight, online courses can broaden the scope of education for students, including classes the region's educational system could not otherwise afford to offer. Those with disabilities, such as an inability to see or hear, may also find that the technology available to them in an online course makes learning easier.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has become a global health crisis. As of October 6, 2020, almost 36 million people have been infected and over one million have died. In the Philippines, this translates into almost 325,000 infected and 6,000 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). To curb the spread of COVID-19, most governments have opted to employ quarantine protocols and temporarily shut down their educational institutions. As a consequence, more than a billion learners have been affected worldwide. Among this number are over 28 million Filipino learners across academic levels who have to stay at home and comply with the Philippine government’s quarantine measures (UNESCO, 2020).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

For several months now, our government together with the rest of the world, has
been planning counter-measures in defeating the
 unseen threat. However, our country
and the world at large are still in dilemma brought about by this Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Philippines, this health crisis has resulted to a major transition especially in
the field of education. One notable effect of this crisis is the adoption of different learning
modalities suited to the context of the school. Similarly, this crisis has caused the public
to express various opinions. Some expressed their disapproval to the new manner of
learning and claimed that many Filipinos are not yet ready to the newly-introduced
modalities such as online classes and blended learning. For them, effective learning
requires real interaction among the teachers and learners. In contrast to this, a certain
author asserted that face-to face learning is NOT necessary in the teaching and learning
process.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has become a global health crisis. As of October 6, 2020, almost 36 million people have been infected and over one million have died. In the Philippines, this translates into almost 325,000 infected and 6,000 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). To curb the spread of COVID-19, most governments have opted to employ quarantine protocols and temporarily shut down their educational institutions. As a consequence, more than a billion learners have been affected worldwide. Among this number are over 28 million Filipino learners across academic levels who have to stay at home and comply with the Philippine government’s quarantine measures (UNESCO, 2020).</p><p></p><p>To respond to the needs of learners, especially of the 3.5 million tertiary-level students enrolled in approximately 2,400 HEIs, certain HEIs in the country have implemented proactive policies for the continuance of education despite the closure. These policies include modified forms of online learning that aim to facilitate student learning activities. Online learning might be in terms of synchronous, real-time lectures and time-based outcomes assessments, or asynchronous, delayed-time activities, like pre-recorded video lectures and time-independent assessments (Oztok et al., 2013). Case in point are top universities in the country, viz., De La Salle University (DLSU), Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), the University of Santo Tomas (UST), and the state-run University of the Philippines, Diliman (UPD).</p><br />

In the philippines this health crisis has resulted to a major transition especially in the field of education. One notable effect of this crisis is the adoption of different learning modalities suited to the context of the school. Similarly this crisis has caused the public to express various opinions. Some express their disapproval to the new manner of learning and claim that many filipinos are not yet ready to the newly introduced modalities such as online classes and blended learning. For them effective learning requires real interaction among the teachers and learners.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Online courses call for a greater amount motivation and self-discipline than a classroom-based course. A classroom has one or more instructors and peers, who can hold a student accountable for their course-work. In contrast, online courses involve setting our own goals, tracking progress and meeting deadlines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kana ra aynag pangutana :))</p><br />

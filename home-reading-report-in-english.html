UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

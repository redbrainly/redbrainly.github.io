The Farmer's Donkey

With each shovel of dirt that hit the donkey's back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up.
As the farmer and his neighbors continued to throw dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and

For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</a>

-Zig Ziglar

down. A few shovel loads later, the former looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.
With each shovel of dirt that hit the donkey's back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up.
As the farmer and his neighbors continued to throw dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and
take another step up. Soon everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the

Kindly shorten your answers thru bulleted form.Leaving the Comfort ZoneBehind Trisha Kris P. AquinoWriting is like talking to somebody, so let me tell you a story. For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</h2><br />

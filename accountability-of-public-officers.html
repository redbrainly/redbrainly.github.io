This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

                                            Make an expository text about this information. Department of National Defense (DND) officer-in-charge Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. clarified that the proposed enhanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program would allow trainees to beef up their resilience and character -- qualities that are believed to foster good mental health. The DND chief made this clarification Monday night after some reports claimed that ROTC would help "cure" or address mental health issues. "We have learned of the sensitivities raised by our mental health practitioners and advocates on what they believe is the improper use at the Senate hearing on Monday, February 6, of the word 'cure' for mental health issues," Galvez said. The DND chief said they understood and appreciated the concerns of these groups as mental health is an issue that affects the broadest spectrum of society. "What we intended to convey during the hearing was that through our enhanced ROTC program, we would be able to build the strength of character and resilience of our trainees, qualities which positively foster mental health," Galvez said. He also added that the ROTC program also aims to develop among the trainees the basic psychosocial support competencies that are crucial in responding to stressful situations and contexts. Galvez stressed that the ROTC program they envisioned in the DND includes courses that are specifically designed to foster resilience, self-leadership, character-building and discipline. "We believe these are virtues that our trainees must cultivate not only for their personal growth and development as individuals, but more importantly, enable them to play a key role in building a just, humane and democratic society," he added. Galvez also assured the public that DND leadership shall carefully take into account the spirit of Republic Act 11036 (Mental Health Act of 2018) and the issues raised by our mental health experts in the crafting of the ROTC training program.​</a>

Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her.

                            11. Make an expository text about this information. Department of National Defense (DND) officer-in-charge Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. clarified that the proposed enhanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program would allow trainees to beef up their resilience and character -- qualities that are believed to foster good mental health. The DND chief made this clarification Monday night after some reports claimed that ROTC would help "cure" or address mental health issues. "We have learned of the sensitivities raised by our mental health practitioners and advocates on what they believe is the improper use at the Senate hearing on Monday, February 6, of the word 'cure' for mental health issues," Galvez said. The DND chief said they understood and appreciated the concerns of these groups as mental health is an issue that affects the broadest spectrum of society. "What we intended to convey during the hearing was that through our enhanced ROTC program, we would be able to build the strength of character and resilience of our trainees, qualities which positively foster mental health," Galvez said. He also added that the ROTC program also aims to develop among the trainees the basic psychosocial support competencies that are crucial in responding to stressful situations and contexts. Galvez stressed that the ROTC program they envisioned in the DND includes courses that are specifically designed to foster resilience, self-leadership, character-building and discipline. "We believe these are virtues that our trainees must cultivate not only for their personal growth and development as individuals, but more importantly, enable them to play a key role in building a just, humane and democratic society," he added. Galvez also assured the public that DND leadership shall carefully take into account the spirit of Republic Act 11036 (Mental Health Act of 2018) and the issues raised by our mental health experts in the crafting of the ROTC training program.​</h2><br />

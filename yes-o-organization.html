                                            Bigyan ng Pagkakataon ang Kapayapaan 
MAILAP ang kapayapaan sa Mindanao. Kalahating siglo na ang paglalaban doon at walang nakikitang pagkakasundo. Marami nang sinubukang paraan ang mga namumuno subalit wala pa ring makitang liwanag. Ayaw sumilip ang kapayapaan. Ayaw magpakita ng tunay na pagkakaisa, pagkakasundo at pagbubuklud-buklod. Dami nang namatay at umagos na dugo pero ayaw pa ring tumigil sa pakikihamok laban sa kalipi at kababayan. Kanya 
kanyang grupo na dahilan nang lalo pang pagkakahati-hati. 
Ngayong araw na ito ang plebisito para sa ratipikasyon ng Republic Act No. 11054 o ang Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). Kapag nanalo ang “yes” vote at naritipikahan ang BOL, ang dating Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) ay magiging Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Kapag naaprubahan, ipinangangako ang malawak pang autonomiya sa mga rehiyon na masasakupan. 
Mahalaga ang partisipasyon ng bawat isa sa makasaysayang plebisito na gagawin ngayon. Kakaiba ito sapagkat nakita ang kaseryosohan ng kasalukuyang pamahalaan na maisulong ang genuine na kapayapaan sa Muslim Mindanao. Hindi ito basta pagpapakitang 
13 
tao lang kundi nilalayon na mawakasan na ang matagal na kaguluhan. Ito ang simula nang bagong umaga sa Mindanao. 
Sabi ni President Duterte sa peace assembly noong Biyernes, ang pag-apruba ng mga mamamayan sa BOL ang maghahatid ng tunay na kapayapaan at tatapos din sa inhustisyang nakakamtan ng mga kapatid na Muslim. Ayon pa sa Presidente, sa pagboto ng “yes” makikita ang determinasyon ng bawat isa na pasilipin at maihatid ang kapayapaang matagal nang inaasam. 
Bigyan ng pagkakataon ang kapayapaan. Ang pag-aapruba sa BOL ang tanging kasagutan dito at wala nang iba. Ang makapagbibigay nang tunay na kapayapaan sa rehiyon ang nararapat na isipin ngayon. Paglimi-limiin ang isasagot sa itatanong sa plebisito ngayong araw na ito. Hindi naman ito mahirap sagutin. Lagi lang isipin na kapayapaan ang hangad kaya makikibahagi sa plebisito. 
Bumoto ngayong araw na ito at ipakita ang pagnanais na makamtan ang tunay na kapayapaan. Bigyan ito ng pagkakataon ngayon.

Indeed, even demonstrations which appear to be less limit, like structure a mud cottage or a photovoltaic framework in the desert, the altered <strong>environment </strong>turns into a fake one. However numerous creatures construct things to give a superior <strong>environment</strong> to themselves, they are not human, subsequently beaver dams, and crafted by hill building termites, are considered as regular.

                            26. Bigyan ng Pagkakataon ang Kapayapaan 
MAILAP ang kapayapaan sa Mindanao. Kalahating siglo na ang paglalaban doon at walang nakikitang pagkakasundo. Marami nang sinubukang paraan ang mga namumuno subalit wala pa ring makitang liwanag. Ayaw sumilip ang kapayapaan. Ayaw magpakita ng tunay na pagkakaisa, pagkakasundo at pagbubuklud-buklod. Dami nang namatay at umagos na dugo pero ayaw pa ring tumigil sa pakikihamok laban sa kalipi at kababayan. Kanya 
kanyang grupo na dahilan nang lalo pang pagkakahati-hati. 
Ngayong araw na ito ang plebisito para sa ratipikasyon ng Republic Act No. 11054 o ang Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). Kapag nanalo ang “yes” vote at naritipikahan ang BOL, ang dating Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) ay magiging Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Kapag naaprubahan, ipinangangako ang malawak pang autonomiya sa mga rehiyon na masasakupan. 
Mahalaga ang partisipasyon ng bawat isa sa makasaysayang plebisito na gagawin ngayon. Kakaiba ito sapagkat nakita ang kaseryosohan ng kasalukuyang pamahalaan na maisulong ang genuine na kapayapaan sa Muslim Mindanao. Hindi ito basta pagpapakitang 
13 
tao lang kundi nilalayon na mawakasan na ang matagal na kaguluhan. Ito ang simula nang bagong umaga sa Mindanao. 
Sabi ni President Duterte sa peace assembly noong Biyernes, ang pag-apruba ng mga mamamayan sa BOL ang maghahatid ng tunay na kapayapaan at tatapos din sa inhustisyang nakakamtan ng mga kapatid na Muslim. Ayon pa sa Presidente, sa pagboto ng “yes” makikita ang determinasyon ng bawat isa na pasilipin at maihatid ang kapayapaang matagal nang inaasam. 
Bigyan ng pagkakataon ang kapayapaan. Ang pag-aapruba sa BOL ang tanging kasagutan dito at wala nang iba. Ang makapagbibigay nang tunay na kapayapaan sa rehiyon ang nararapat na isipin ngayon. Paglimi-limiin ang isasagot sa itatanong sa plebisito ngayong araw na ito. Hindi naman ito mahirap sagutin. Lagi lang isipin na kapayapaan ang hangad kaya makikibahagi sa plebisito. 
Bumoto ngayong araw na ito at ipakita ang pagnanais na makamtan ang tunay na kapayapaan. Bigyan ito ng pagkakataon ngayon.

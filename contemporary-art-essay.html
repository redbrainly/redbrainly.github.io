                        <p>Answer:Contemporary Art: Dealing with Post-Modernity− ”Art worlds consist of all the people whose activities are necessary to the production of the characteristic works which that world, and perhaps others as well, define as art.By observing how an art world makes those distinctions rather than trying to make them ourselves we can understand much of what goes on in that world. The basic unit of analysis, then, is an art world.”- Howard Becker (Art Worlds)Postmodernism deconstructs Modernism like Modernism deconstructed artLike the Simpson's episode that explained Po-Mo as “weird for the sake of weird”,Postmodernism accepted the philosophy “art for the sake of art”. A very free and democratic practice, a natural response.Postmodernism embraces hypertext and hyperplicity, or the rejection of centralized control. It looses trust in the media and public communication, embracing simulacrum as a hyper-reality that was only long-ago based on some sort of truth. Most importantly, Postmodernism rejects theModernist idea of high art as normative and dominant. Instead, it merges the concept of “low” and “high” art, effectively canceling them both. Where Modernism saw a work of art as a finished product, signed by the artist and authenticated by the art market,Postmodernism sees art as a recycling of culture, authenticated by whatever audience that may be. Where Modern art is a separate dichotomy of contrasting themes (organic/nonorganic, realist/abstract), Postmodern art mixes all available ideas into a sensational pastiche. Finally Modernism clearly divided normity versus sexual difference and pornography. Postmodernism embraces whatever ideas have an audience, and mixes polymorphous sexuality and pornography with mainstream media. Postmodernist art and media reject the linear way of working, building upon a specific discourse and ideology. It embraces instead, an anything-goes attitude, expanding mediums and messages into multiple directions. As long as there's an audience somewhere, the work can be considered legitimate art.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Well it depends on you definition of “traditional”. If you are talking about everything before the 1600’s in Europe as “traditional”, then one thing I would point out is the evolution of self determination for artists. At in point art was a trade and the artist was commissioned to paint what the patrons wanted. Usually the patrons were the wealthy or members of the christian clergy. With the Renaissance there were a lot of paintings of holy subjects and another subject called “myth”, which was basically an excuse to have paintings of half naked people in ones private quarters. There were also the ideas of the individual. No one signed their paintings before this time. So it was a humanist idea to place your mark on the painting in order to say “this is my work, I did this”.</p><p></p><p>Another point</p><p>Michelangelo was a sculptor by trade. But the Pope loved his work so much that he commissioned him to paint the Sistine Chapel.</p><p>Think about this. How much cussing and swearing was involved in learning how to paint frescos while laying on a scaffold? Then getting off of the scaffold to discover that the paintings looked tiny from the floor.</p><p>My Point is that artists were told what to create. It wasn’t until later periods that Artists had more freedom to create what they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Later artists did a lot of work with allegory up until the very tale end of the 19th century. Then you had Artists that started doing their own thing like Fauvism, which was experimenting with non-local colours (colours that we wouldn’t use to depict realism), artists like Rosa Bonheur that chose to represent everyday subject matter in large scale painting usually reserved for religious and mythical paintings.</p><br />

                            11. differentiate contemporary arts practices to contemporary art techniques​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Contemporary art is often looked at with a skeptical eye. The truth about contemporary art is that it uses techniques that most people aren’t quite used to, causing that skepticism to come into play. However, these techniques are actually quite difficult and all deserve our credit. It’s an incredible feat to create a piece of contemporary art, especially using these techniques. They challenge the mind and offer unique perspectives in a way that art has never been able to do before. For that reason, they’re some of the most valuable techniques that a person can experience through artwork. Here are three techniques that are among the most relevant in contemporary art today.</p><p></p><p>1. MINIMALISM</p><p></p><p>One of the artistic movements that has been most relevant throughout the contemporary art movement is minimalism. Minimalism seeks to take away what’s unnecessary and leaving only what’s essential. Minimalism is incredibly difficult and has even made its way into being a huge part of branding and design for companies all over the world. This is probably the most important part of contemporary art, as it has informed so much of society. Have you noticed that branding has gotten more minimalist over the past ten years or so? You can thank the contemporary art movement for doing that.</p><p></p><p>2. FOUND OBJECTS</p><p></p><p>Taking something that people view as useless, and then using it in a unique way in order to make artwork is one of the most important movements that currently exist in contemporary artwork. The idea is that things that we often view as junk are actually more valuable than we think that they are. Everything you find can be used to tell a story, or to create new diverse perspectives that we’re looking for when we attend an art exhibitions. The found objects movement is one of the most important movements in all of contemporary art currently.</p><p></p><p>3. LARGE-SCALE ART</p><p></p><p>Walter De Maria created an art piece in 1977 that included a four hundred steel poles over one mile by one kilometer. That’s incredible. Creating something huge to express diverse perspectives in artwork is incredibly popular, even today. Over the past forty years, large scale art, and art that includes the environment has come into its own as one of the most important movements within contemporary art. That’s why you often see modern art pieces alongside buildings, or as huge structures out in the open.</p><p></p><p>CONTEMPORARY ARTWORK RELIES ON CERTAIN TECHNIQUES</p><p></p><p>With every new age of art, there are new unique techniques that define how the movement develops. For contemporary art, among many techniques, you can find techniques such as minimalism, found objects, and large scale paintings. Each of these bring their own unique perspective into the artistic community, and each is valued as a pick for a technique that is most influential in contemporary art. Look out for these when you’re out at an exhibition next, you’ll find that they’re much more relevant than you perhaps think that they are.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1. What Makes Art Art?
</p><p>
Art is an object or piece of work that brings one pleasure. Art is also something you see or feel and you cannot even begin to describe the ways you like it or how it makes you feel. Art is something that portrays beauty and happiness.  Art lets you see the world through another person’s perspective. Most art seems to tell a story about where a person has been and the things they have encountered along the way. It lets you connect with the artist and see things through their eyes. Art is a way of expressing one’s self without words. When I think of art, I think of paintings, portraits, sketches, and sculptures The scene has two snowmen at the entrance to the covered bridge. It fills your heart with warmth and holiday spirit just to look at it.  </p><p>
</p><p>Portraits to me are art in a different sense. Some of my favorite portraits are by Martin Waugh. It is what he calls Liquid Sculpture. He uses high speed photography to capture drops of liquid as the splash into lakes and other bodies of water. To me there is just something so soothing about his work. It is amazing how a tiny drop of liquid can create such a beautiful work of art. His work impresses me, because I never really thought of liquid as art before I saw one of his photos.      
</p><p>
</p><p>The formal qualities of art work are somewhat important. I like paintings that flow smoothly with very fine brush strokes. I think some of the most beautiful art work is produced with a combination of canvas and oil paints. I like portraits that capture images I normally could not see otherwise. Portraits that capture the colors you can see when light reflects on a ripple of water amaze me. I do not know a great deal about art, but art seems to be much more opinion than ever.</p><p></p><p>2. the term "contemporaryart" refers to art made and produced by artists living today. Today's artists work in and respond to a global environment that is culturally diverse, technologically advancing, and multifaceted. Working in a wide range of mediums, contemporary artists often reflect and comment on modern-day society.</p><p>

                        ·Contemporary Art means<br /><br /> "art that has been and continues to be created during our lifetimes". Art that was created from the 1960's/1970's up until now is considered contemporary art. This type of art is known to be much more socially conscious than any previous era has been. <br /><br />Traditional Art<br /><br />Traditional art consisted of many art forms that were relevant to the past. Some of these art forms include paintings, sculptures, printmaking, mosaics and drawings. Traditional art was prominently created using cultural perspectives and ideas, this means that different cultures used different materials and processes to display their own cultural ideas. For example, "The Last Judgement" by Michelangelo, expresses his view of religion and beliefs. And, Raphael's self portrait showed realism, a common traditional technique.<br />

These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

                                            1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High Schoolis aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised someconsiderations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodatethe big tumout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules thateventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morningand afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept morestudents and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them!with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quiteoverwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape theirleaming experiences. - "Slip of the Tongue" by Karylle Anne CabuyaoPremise:Conclusion:​</a>

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center. Good day and God bless!​</a>

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</a>

                                            1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High School is aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised some considerations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodate the big turnout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules that eventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morning and afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept more students and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quite overwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape their learning experiences. - “Slip of the Tongue” by Karylle Anne Cabuyao.​</a>

It is a review of the selected academic papers which delves into the ICT-Integration in the Educational System of Philippines. The formal efforts of the government were also highlighted including the prime importance of ICT in education. The paper does not only embolden a problem of the inadequacy of the school facilities but it highlights how this problem affects the competitiveness of Filipinos in the job market and the backwardness of the standing of the country in technological advancement.​</a>

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center.

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Malnutrition Parents who did not invest in proper care for their children and not enough money for the familyBy supporting families who can't afford to take care the health of their children. No, because the children have learn a lesson from their parents to apply it to theirselves. It is superveneficial especially to children who are not provided a proper care. I agree whit the author because addressing malnutrition and knowing the cause will help governme t to take action<p></p><br />

Originality - The paper provided a lens both on the problematic situation on the actual school set-ups and also the possible key steps to be undertaken for improvement. It is a review of the selected academic papers which delves into the ICT-Integration in the Educational System of Philippines. The formal efforts of the government were also highlighted including the prime importance of ICT in education. The paper does not only embolden a problem of the inadequacy of the school facilities but it highlights how this problem affects the competitiveness of Filipinos in the job market and the backwardness of the standing of the country in technological advancement.​</h2><br />

                            28. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

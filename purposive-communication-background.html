                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>T </strong>1. Humans always communicate a with purpose.</p><p><strong>Because </strong><strong>people </strong><strong>has </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>ability</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>communicate</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>they </strong><strong>communicate</strong><strong> </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>purpose </strong><strong>so </strong><strong>they </strong><strong>don't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>waste </strong><strong>their </strong><strong>ability.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>F </strong>2. Communication only takes place between two or more people. <strong>Communication </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>also </strong><strong>take </strong><strong>place </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>one </strong><strong>person </strong><strong>only,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>other </strong><strong>creatures </strong><strong>such </strong><strong>as </strong><strong>animals </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>also </strong><strong>communicate</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>T </strong>3. The participants of communication take turns in playing the role of sender and receiver. <strong>The </strong><strong>sender </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>one </strong><strong>who </strong><strong>talks </strong><strong>or </strong><strong>creates </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>topic,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>receiver </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>one </strong><strong>who </strong><strong>listens </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>sender.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>F </strong>4. An exchange of meaning takes place between sender and receiver when there is an overlap in the field of experience between the <strong>communicators</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Communication</strong><strong> </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>take </strong><strong>place </strong><strong>even </strong><strong>though</strong><strong> </strong><strong>there's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>not </strong><strong>much </strong><strong>experience</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>F </strong>5. Some are born speakers. Other are born writers. <strong>I </strong><strong>believe</strong><strong> </strong><strong>that </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>person </strong><strong>could </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>both </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>writer </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>speaker.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>F </strong>6. Our educational and religious background affect the way we create and enter great messages. <strong>Our </strong><strong>educational</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>religious</strong><strong> </strong><strong>background</strong><strong> </strong><strong>doesn't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>affect </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>way </strong><strong>we </strong><strong>enter </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>messages </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>we </strong><strong>are </strong><strong>all </strong><strong>same </strong><strong>living</strong><strong> </strong><strong>things </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>doesn't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>matter.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>T </strong>7. Communication is a cyclical <strong>process.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Because</strong><strong> </strong><strong>once </strong><strong>two </strong><strong>people </strong><strong>share </strong><strong>their</strong><strong> </strong><strong>communication </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>other </strong><strong>people,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>keeps </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>spreading,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>until </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>get </strong><strong>backs </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>two </strong><strong>people </strong><strong>who </strong><strong>shared </strong><strong>it.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so </strong><strong>it's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>cyclical </strong><strong>process</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong>8. We can both be sender and receiver at the same time. <strong>I </strong><strong>agree </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>we </strong><strong>have </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>ability</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>both </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>more </strong><strong>better </strong><strong>communication</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>T </strong>9. We make ethical judgments when we communicate. <strong>I </strong><strong>agree,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>but </strong><strong>sometimes</strong><strong> </strong><strong>we </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>don't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>notice </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>don't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mind,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>which </strong><strong>cause </strong><strong>other </strong><strong>people</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>misunderstand </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>more.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>T </strong>10.

internet connectivity is not as fast here as it is elsewhere. If a middle- class family is struggling to keep
up with education because three siblings have to attend classes all at the same time, all with their own
bit of technology and forced to share a shaky internet connection, how much more difficult will it be for
a lower- class family, already struggling to pay for food and water, to afford the internet, the gadgets, or even the textbooks required?

Things changed from the daily norm we had grown accustomed to, and now we are forced to accept this
strange new world. It is not easy to forget that we live in a Third world country. Among other things,
internet connectivity is not as fast here as it is elsewhere. If a middle- class family is struggling to keep
up with education because three siblings have to attend classes all at the same time, all with their own
bit of technology and forced to share a shaky internet connection, how much more difficult will it be for
a lower- class family, already struggling to pay for food and water, to afford the internet, the gadgets, or even the textbooks required?

The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</a>

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</h2><br />

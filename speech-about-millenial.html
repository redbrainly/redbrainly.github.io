But there’s the rub: tolerance of speech applies to everyone, not the ones who we decide deserve<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> "Millennial Generation"</p><p>Persuasive Speech-Millennial Generation Millennial Generation defines a group of people born between 1982 and 2003 (Dews, 2014). I belong to this generation and I believe our loss of empathetic nature coupled with other adverse traits exposes us to many odds and hence the need to change our priorities and behaviors. The rising cost of living, high rising tuition fees, unemployment, and global issues like global warming force Millennials to seek self-centered success. Millennials lack empathetic nature for one another and focus on individual interests. Millennials disintegrate themselves from other generations and disregard communal endeavors. They can rarely trust other people. Indeed, our generation is self-centered where we mainly focus on our careers and seek to be different in all areas. However, despite having higher levels of education, many Millennials are still unemployed since they mostly target white-collar jobs. Although 34 % of Millennials have bachelor’s degrees, 26 % of them struggle to secure employment (Raphelson, 2014). Millennials have different views on important traditional institutions like religion and marriage. They disregard older generations and cling to their independent and sometimes ignorant views (Wilson, 2014). Millennials are not keen on marriage with only 26 % of Millennials getting married before attaining the age of 32 years (Raphelson, 2014). Moreover, only 36 % of Millennials had religious affiliations by 2014 when about 79 % of Generation X was religious by this time (Wilson, 2014). Millennials are more liberal where we focus on the fight for gay rights and marijuana legalization than being patriotic to the government (Wilson, 2014). Unlike 64 % of Generation X who were patriotic, only 49 % of Millennials are patriotic (Wilson, 2014). Millennials waste their time on social media broadcasting themselves that jeopardizes their privacy and concentration on important collective engagements (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014). We also expect rewards to perform better and rely on our parents to do everything for us that limit our input in different areas. Millennials are so impatient and handle things in the ineffective combat style. Apparently, to overcome various odds that are against them, Millennials must change their priorities and behaviors by integrating with other generations, embracing diversity, supporting government initiatives, establishing effective collaborations, and remaining focused to important endeavors. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>welcome</p><p></p><br />

                        Millineal—  those are the youth of today. <br />I have one question for the so called millennials. <br />What makes you different from the youth of yesterday?<br /><br />Speak with caution, because you might end up bashful for not really knowing what your age is all about. <br /><br />How it has become different has nothing to do with people being born on the mark of the year 2000.  Neither the technologies being invented nor the infrastructures have made its distinction. <br /><br />It's how the people received it. It's how the people viewed it. <br /><br />One example is a cell phone. A cell phone doesn't make a person different, it doesn't distinguish a person's social status. It's not the brand of your cellphone that measures who you are. It's the people who created the thought, that the more expensive your cell phone is, the more attention you will get.<br /><br />Milineal is just a part of the whole existence of this world. <br />absolutely not the kind of people who we should be. People who are less sensitive to other's needs, people who care more about their career than family, people whose respect for the elderlies are diminishing.<br /><br />Milineal is simply a milestone.Not— a change of behavior.<br /><br /><br />

                        Millennials are found to be lazy and narcissistic. They expect everything to be handed down to them as if they are entitled to it. Older generations picture us sitting on a couch with our feet up in the air, starring like a zombie into our screens on our phones, while taking selfies every five minutes, demanding our boss to give us a raise. If only the people who judge us knew how hard we really have it in today’s world. Liz Zarka’s 2013 article entitled “Generation Me: The Millennial Generation’s Obsession with Being Unique”, from The Daily Clog,states her beliefs that Millennials are more focused on ourselves verses helping our planet. She assumes we are self-absorbed, conceded, and only care about fame and do not care about changing the way people see us. However, I believe the millennials are an admirable generation because we can multitask, we see the value in higher education, and we are aspirational.<br />

Furthermore, the majority of them now dominate the internet. They were better versed about how technology functioned properly than other generations since they had spent more time on the internet.</p><p></p>Claim of Policy<p>Aside from their computer proficiency, millennials should improve their fact-checking skills.

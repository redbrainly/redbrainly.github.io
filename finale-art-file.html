Color your outlines. You can do many things at this point depending on your skills, style and your facility with the program. You may add another layer for more details or you may just color your line-art like a coloring book.       If you don't have a scanner, you can  make your sketch in your art program or you can just take a photo of your sketch. C       Create a new transparent layer and create an outline of your sketch. This will allow you to make details and necessary changes without messing up your sketch. The outline will make applying color easier.     Think of an idea or theme to paint and sketch it on paper using a pencil. Don't add much detail yet. With the pencil, you can easily erase some parts before finalizing your drawing     Open your file. As a beginner, you may use GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), a free program to edit and retouch your image or sketch. 000        Merge all the layers you created when you are done. Merge all layers into one to save in PNG and JPEG formats            Scan your sketch and save it as .PNG or JPEG for excellent quality.​</a>

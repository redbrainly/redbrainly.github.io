                            1. What is the reflection of Matthew 3:1-12?​</h2><br />
                        Reflection of Matthew 3: 1-12<p></p><p>There are many points considered in the <strong>reflection of Matthew 3: 1-12</strong>. One of them is repentance. <strong>Matthew 3: 1-12 </strong>is about John the Baptist who, as Isaiah the prophet described, called the people to prepare the way of the Lord Jesus Christ before he was born as a human. John is calling the Israelites to prepare the way of the Lord by repenting and turning away from sins. Consequently, he baptized with water those who repented as a symbol of cleansing from the sins they committed. </p><p></p><p>More so, John the Baptist affirmed that those who claim to be descendants of Abraham and do not need cleansing are not exempted from the final judgment. Everyone is subject to final judgment. As such, it also meant that salvation is not only for those who are descendants of Abraham. It is available to everyone who is willing to receive it.</p><p></p><p>Another interesting <strong>reflection of Matthew 3: 1-12 </strong>is the humility of John the Baptist. He was appointed by God to become a prophet and a preacher - both noble tasks. In humility, he accepted his calling. Interestingly, even if it's God who has appointed him, he also knew that Someone mightier than him is coming. He even revealed that he is not worthy to even carry this One's sandals. Humility is a virtue that is often forgotten and overshadowed by pride and vain. It keeps a person's eyes and heart away from necessary repentance and from learning obedience, kindness, and wisdom.</p><p></p>More Bible Readings Related to Matthew 3: 1-12Mark 1: 2-8Luke 3: 1-18John 1: 19-28<p></p><p>Read another gospel <strong>reflection </strong>here: https://brainly.ph/question/2396176</p><br />

                            2. Matthew 2:1-12 Reflection </h2><br />
                        <p>There are some significant events in Jesus' life that we can gather into these scripture. We will be using question and answer to show the reflections.</p><p><strong>1. Are the visitors of Jesus truly kings?</strong></p><p>Reference: Matthew 2:1  After Jesus had been born in Bethʹle·hem of Ju·deʹa in the days of Herod the king, look! <strong>astrologers</strong> from the East came to Jerusalem, </p><p>Answer: They were an astrologers, possibly sorcerers who are very interested to any magical interpretation presented by the stars. This work actually prohibits by God to Israelite.</p><p><strong>2. Is the star came from the true God?</strong></p><p>Reference:   Matthew 2:2,3 saying: “Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw <strong>his star</strong> when we were in the East, and we have come to do obeisance to him.” At hearing this, <strong>King Herod was agitated</strong>, and all Jerusalem with him. </p><p>Answer: By saying star, it is surely different from other stars in heaven which are very familiar with astrologers. But we knew that God will never use an astrologers to proclaim the good news about the birth of Jesus. He already gave this privilege to some shepherds during the actual night of his birth. In addition, the stars guided the astrologers not directly to Jesus but the King Heron who was agitated that someone will take over his position. These scenarios will let you know that this star is not a normal one neither from God. But from whom the star came? From Satan himself who wanted to kill the baby. </p><p><strong>3. What is the evidence that Satan was the who gave the star?</strong></p><p>Reference: Matthew 2:9,12 After they had heard the king, they went their way, and look! <strong>the star they had seen when they were in the East went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the young child was</strong>. . . <strong>However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.</strong></p><p>Answer: After directing to King Herod who had an evil plan to kill Jesus, the star suddenly stopped in the very house of Mar and Joseph. But God forbidden the astrologers to return to King Herod. When King Herod knew that the astrologers did not return, he decided to kill all child 2 years of age and below. Now we can clearly say, that the star had the aim to kill the baby Jesus. But God obstructed his evil plan. Jesus had flee before the massacre.</p><p><strong>4. Is Jesus an newborn when astrologers visited him?</strong></p><p>Reference: Matthew 2:9,12 After they had heard the king, they went their way, and look! the star they had seen when they were in the East went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the <strong>young child </strong>was</p><p>Answer: Jesus was not a newborn anymore. He was more or less 2 years of age as what is expected calculation of Jews about the Messiah.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Is the bible really supports the use of a symbol of star for his birth? The answer is clear! God did not provide the star.</strong></p><br /><br />

                        <p>(Matthew 22:1-14)</p><p> is the parable of the wedding banquet. The king represents God who sends out his messengers (the disciples) to invite VIP guests. In the two times his messengers invite guests, they were scorned and even maltreated and killed. With the banquet already set, the king sends his messengers to the fringes to invite everyone who would care to accept.</p><p>We are all invited to a life of love for and service to our God. But we must wear the garment of righteousness and love that is proper and resplendently reserved for a heavenly banquet to be let in. Sadly, many who are called come in improper clothing. </p><br />

(<strong>Matthew 25:4</strong>)</p><p>It tells us that we should think about the future and not the present alone. Christ said that he will come in the time we don't expect.

                            10. Reflection for Matthew 22:1-14</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today I'm going to reflect on the Gospel for 28th Sunday of Ordinary Time, Matthew 22. 1-14.</p><p></p><p>This contains two related parables. In these the Kingdom of Heaven is presented as the wedding banquet of a certain king's son -obviously God's.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the invitation and how people respond to it. Such an invitation would be the greatest honour imaginable that the king could confer on His subjects.The parable is referring to the Chosen People of God. "I shall be your God – you shall be my people." The king expected them to come. But they found all kinds of excuses for refusing the invitation. Some of them even seized the servant carrying the invitations, maltreated them and killed them. Such behaviour was outrageous!!The king was furious. How dare they insult the King and his son in this way! Through this parable Jesus was pointing an accusing finger at God's Chosen People, who, in the main, rejected His Son, Jesus.</p><p></p><p>I expect we are shocked by the king destroying those murderers and burning their town. But Matthew probably added this verse to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, more than 40 years after Christ's Ascension.</p><p></p><p>The king in the parable was not to be mocked! God is not to be mocked! Like the king, God was determined to have guests at His Son's heavenly banquet.So, He invited those whom pious Jews would have rejected.Those included pagans, the outcasts of society and sinners. They gladly accepted God's invitation.</p><p></p><p>But God insists on certain requirements before He welcomes anyone into His Kingdom.That's the point of the second parable about the wedding garment. But what's the meaning of the man refusing to wear it?</p><p></p><p>At baptism we become God's children and begin to share His divine life.This is God's free gift to us, which none of us deserves.We were clothed in a white garment, suggesting our putting on Christ and being surrounded by His love.In our culture white suggests purity, which we are urged to preserve throughout our lives.In this parable the man wanted to be welcomed into heaven, while refusing to be clothed with Christ.He didn't want to wear the garment of Christ's salvation, freely offered to Him. The man refusing to meet God's requirements for entry into His kingdom will be treated in the same way as someone refusing to wear the tie provided by some posh restaurant as a condition of entry.</p><p></p><p>So, what do these two related parables mean for us?Well, they're both concerned with God inviting us to the marriage banquet of His kingdom.In the first parable there are those who refuse to come, because they think they've got more important things to do.That can be very true of us if our preoccupations lead us not to heed Christ's call to follow Him.</p><p></p><p>This is developed in the parable about the white garment.We will only be welcomed into God's kingdom if we welcome Christ's gift of salvation.Like the riff-raff in this parable we must shed the soiled garments of sin and be clothed with Christ.In other words, we must repent for our sins and allow ourselves to be wrapped in the gift of God's love and mercy.God invites and wants to welcome all of us into His kingdom.But do we really want that, and are we prepared to do what He requires of us?</p><p></p><p>Do you, do I, chose to say, 'Yes' to God and eagerly welcome His invitation to His Son's heavenly banquet?Or do we find what we think are more important things to do?Do we repent for sins and wear Christ's garment of salvation? God wants us welcome us ; do we really want to be with Him?!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. Then Peter said to Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!’ When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, ‘Get up and do not be afraid.’ And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.</p><p></p><p>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, ‘Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.’</p><p></p><p>Matthew 17:1–9</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>carry on learning ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ</p><br />

                        <p>Matthew 4:1-11 recounts the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness. This passage is significant because it shows us how Jesus overcame temptation and remained faithful to God's will.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning of the passage, Jesus fasts for forty days and nights in the wilderness, and Satan comes to tempt him. The first temptation is for Jesus to turn stones into bread to satisfy His hunger, but Jesus responds by quoting scripture: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."</p><p></p><p>The second temptation is for Jesus to jump off the pinnacle of the temple, with the devil challenging Him to test God's protection. However, Jesus again responds with scripture, saying "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for his worship. But Jesus rebukes him, saying "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.'"</p><p></p><p>This passage teaches us the importance of staying true to God's will and relying on scripture to overcome temptation. Even though Jesus was hungry, tired, and facing extreme temptation, He remained faithful to God's word and resisted the devil's offers. As followers of Christ, we can learn from His example and remember that God's word is a powerful weapon against temptation.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><p>In Matthew 3:1-12, John the Baptist is introduced as a prophet who prepares the way for Jesus. He preached a message of repentance and baptized people in the Jordan River as a symbol of their repentance. When Jesus came to be baptized, John initially hesitated, recognizing that Jesus was the one he was preparing the way for and that Jesus should be baptizing him. However, Jesus insisted on being baptized as an example of humility and obedience. Some possible reflections and learnings from this passage are:</p><p></p><p>John the Baptist was a humble and obedient servant of God, willing to fulfill his role in preparing the way for Jesus even though it meant relinquishing his own status.</p><p>Repentance is an important aspect of following God, as it involves acknowledging our sin and turning away from it.</p><p>Jesus' example of humility in being baptized by John shows that he was not afraid to humble himself and follow God's will, even if it involved going against cultural norms or expectations.</p><p>Baptism is a symbol of cleansing and rebirth, representing the change that occurs in a person's life when they turn to God.</p><p>The presence of the Holy Spirit descending on Jesus at his baptism confirms his divine identity and mission.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew 3:1-12 is the story of John the Baptist's ministry in the wilderness of Judea</strong>. John was a prophet who preached repentance and baptized people in the Jordan River as a sign of their repentance. Many people came to him to be baptized, including the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were religious leaders among the Jews.</p><p></p><p>John warned the Pharisees and Sadducees that their status as religious leaders would not save them from God's judgment if they did not repent and bear fruit worthy of repentance. He also announced that someone greater than he was coming, who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire.</p><p></p><p>Some possible reflections and learnings from this passage are:</p><p></p>Repentance is an important part of the Christian faith. It involves acknowledging our sinfulness and turning away from our wrong actions and attitudes in order to live a more faithful and obedient life.<p></p>God's judgment is fair and just, and he expects all people, regardless of their status or position, to repent and turn to him.<p></p>John the Baptist was a forerunner of Jesus, announcing his coming and preparing the way for him.<p></p>Jesus is the one who brings the gift of the Holy Spirit, which empowers us to live a life of righteousness and to bear fruit for God's kingdom.<p></p>The fire of God's judgment can purify and refine us, but it can also consume and destroy those who refuse to repent and turn to him.<p></p><p>____________________________________________________</p><p></p>i hope this helps!<br />

                            27. Reflection: 
Matthew 7:12: “In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you….” </h2><br />
                        Scripture. It is often referred to as the Golden Rule. A traditional English phrasing of this is "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It's easy for modern readers to forget how much Christ's teachings changed the world, and how ingrained some of His ideas have become into western culture. This statement is vaguely similar to remarks made by other spiritual leaders in history, but it comes with a drastically different perspective. <br /><br />Jesus was not the first to commend evaluating behavior in light of how you would want to be treated. Earlier Jewish and Greek teachers offer it, as well, as a negative statement: some form of "don't do to anyone what you would not want done to you." In almost all cases, this mostly implies that one ought to "do no harm," meaning not to actively do evil. Jesus' phrasing goes much further: positive action is part of the rule. God expects us to do—to actively pursue—that which we would like to see from others. This idea is expanded in Jesus' later comments about the commandments of God (Matthew 22:34–40). <br /><br />The fact that Jesus taught the Golden Rule endorses this principle as the will of God. Jesus also teaches here that this was the proper explanation behind the Law of Moses and God's word to Israel through the prophets. God wants His people to treat others as they want to be treated. This is an incredibly helpful maxim, since it can be applied to most situations in life without need for a specific rule for every possible incident. <br /><br />Later in Matthew's book, Jesus will describe another set of commands as the basis for all the Law and the Prophets: Love God and love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:34–40). What Jesus calls the second greatest commandment—to love one's neighbor with the love one has for him- or herself—pushes the Golden Rule past simply treating others with decency to being motivated by love for everyone.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My reflections to this is that though our true home is in heaven we are also citizens of the world. We have a duty to respect the government of the country in which we live, and to obey the laws which it enacts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jesus understands the interlocking of the two commandments in a new and quite radical way. "You cannot have one without the other. Without the love of neighbor, the love of God remains a barren emotion; and without the love of God, love of neighbor is but a refined form of self-love."</p><br />

                            30. Matthew 6:2-3 Reflection Write in 10 Sentences​</h2><br />
                        <strong>MATTHEW 6:2-3 REFLECTION</strong><p><strong>2 “Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Gospel is saying that when we are offering help to others, it is not necessary for us to tell everybody that we are helping them. Those actions are usually done by hypocrites. When we lend our helping hands to the needy, we must do it with all our hearts without expecting something in return. Selfish motivation poisons charity into serving spiritual pride. Rather, we ought to serve God out of a pure heart. Public acts of good are part of God's will, but only when they bring glory to God. What Jesus condemns here is motivation—acting "in order to" gain worldly praise. Let God rewards us for the goodness we did.</p><p></p><p>REFLECTION TO THE GOSPEL brainly.ph/question/815462</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

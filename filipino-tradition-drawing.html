Usually the whole family prepares and everyone, especially with culinary expertise, brings out the best of their specialty dishes. This was so in the home of our Lola Asyon in Talisay. Lola Asyon has long gone but the tradition lives on with her grandchildren and great grandchildren. There was lechon, of course, but there was much more as prepared by the family. We were excited to taste the contribution of each. These fiestas are melancholic. The house of Lola Asyon was a highlight of my youth when we would all gather usually in the Sunday afternoons. A whole bunch of us would jump into that tiny kidney pool (how 20 of us fitted is incomprehensible now), have banca rides along the Matab-ang river, and it was pure joy playing games with fellow cousins. Fiestas are important events because they merge and nurture culture, history, family relationships and camaraderie, and also introduce us to new acquaintances. We pray that the tradition of celebrating fiestas in honor of our patron saints will not be relegated to an urban legend in the future.

                                            what is the main topic of the passage?The Philippines' multi-ethnic past makes Filipino cuisine a unique blend of Eastern and Western food, drawing from Spanish, Chinese and Malay recipes. Filipino chefs adopted Spanish ways of cooking during three centuries of Spanish colonization. Perhaps the most important method garnered from traditional Spanish cuisine was making savory marinades to flavor dishes. According to the New York Times, some food experts estimate that about 80 percent of Filipino dishes are derived from Spanish cooking.Food in the Philippines also relies heavily on ingredients used by the islands' original inhabitants, the Malays, including coconut, hot chilies and mango. Early Chinese colonists introduced pansit noodles and bean curds to the islands, which are still widely served across the Philippines today.​</a>

Usually the whole family prepares and everyone, especially with culinary expertise, brings out the best of their specialty dishes. This was so in the home of our Lola Asyon in Talisay. Lola Asyon has long gone but the tradition lives on with her grandchildren and great grandchildren. There was lechon, of course, but there was much more as prepared by the family. We were excited to taste the contribution of each. These fiestas are melancholic. The house of Lola Asyon was a highlight of my youth when we would all gather usually in the Sunday afternoons. A whole bunch of us would jump into that tiny kidney pool (how 20 of us fitted is incomprehensible now), have banca rides along the Matab-ang river, and it was pure joy playing games with fellow cousins. Fiestas are important events because they merge and nurture culture, history, family relationships and camaraderie, and also introduce us to new acquaintances. We pray that the tradition of celebrating fiestas in honor of our patron saints will not be relegated to an urban legend in the future.

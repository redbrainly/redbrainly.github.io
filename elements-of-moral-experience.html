Each of these different codes of ridicule. do not, it is looked upon with amusement or seems reasonable to those who practice it, but to those whoIn much of India and the Muslim world women still veilthe face as well as the body; in Europe they cover the bòdybut expose the face; in many parts of Africa and the SouthSeas they leave the breąstß bare, and in some regions they goentirely neked. In each case, no shame is felt by the peoplethemselves, though we think veiling the face is stùpid and bar-ing the bòdy improper. When Chinese and Eskimo women nowear trousers, we think it quaint, yet in Europe women maywear them for sports or work because they are more practical.Differences in more fundamental sëxx relations aròùße ourdeep emotions. In Western civilization monogamy is the idealform of marriage, enforced by the lay and the Church. Else-where, polygamy, often common, is thought disgusting andimmoral, though some countries allow it by their religion, andothers justify it for economic reasons or for the preservationof the health of the growing child. In Europe again, the moralcode upholds chastity for both sêxès before marriage, thoughin practice it is relaxed for men and is now less strict thanformerly for women. In many native communities premaritalsêxx relations are expected of young people. They hold that inthese matters experience teaches, while we feel that in refer-ence to this, a little learning is a dangerus thing.The religions of the world, in spite of their many commonelements, show equally deep-seated differences of belief andpractice. Philosophers and theologians may agree upon thefundamentals of faith, but the ordinary man clings to his ta-boos in the conviction that they are sensible and right. Thestrict Moslim may eat no pork, the strict Hindu, no beef; butthe strict Christiann may eat both-except perhaps on Fridays.The Brahmanic bull of Hindu India swings through the ba-zaars and eats his fill; the European sees in him a wastefulconcession to religious prejudice and thinks how much betterhe would be occupied in pulling a plough or converted intosteaks. The protest of the Hindu Orthodox groups of North-ern India against public ox-roasting, proposed in 1937 tocelebrate the coronation of their Majesties in Great Britain,must have seemed comic to many Englishmen. A tradition ofbeef-eating, plus a religion deeply imbued with the symbol-ism of sacrifice and of communion through partaking of fleshand bluud, finds it difficult to appreciate the sincerity of a faithwhich believes in bluudless offerings and in the venerationof a sacred animal. A cynical Hindu might say, on the otherhand, that the only calf we venerate is a golden one.litnu fon lud bom nem amo​</a>

In Western civilization monogamy is the idealform of marriage, enforced by the lay and the Church. Else-where, polygamy, often common, is thought disgusting andimmoral, though some countries allow it by their religion, andothers justify it for economic reasons or for the preservationof the health of the growing child. In Europe again, the moralcode upholds chastity for both sêxès before marriage, thoughin practice it is relaxed for men and is now less strict thanformerly for women. In many native communities premaritalsêxx relations are expected of young people. They hold that inthese matters experience teaches, while we feel that in refer-ence to this, a little learning is a dangerus thing.The religions of the world, in spite of their many commonelements, show equally deep-seated differences of belief andpractice. Philosophers and theologians may agree upon thefundamentals of faith, but the ordinary man clings to his ta-boos in the conviction that they are sensible and right. Thestrict Moslim may eat no pork, the strict Hindu, no beef; butthe strict Christiann may eat both-except perhaps on Fridays.The Brahmanic bull of Hindu India swings through the ba-zaars and eats his fill; the European sees in him a wastefulconcession to religious prejudice and thinks how much betterhe would be occupied in pulling a plough or converted intosteaks. The protest of the Hindu Orthodox groups of North-ern India against public ox-roasting, proposed in 1937 tocelebrate the coronation of their Majesties in Great Britain,must have seemed comic to many Englishmen. A tradition ofbeef-eating, plus a religion deeply imbued with the symbol-ism of sacrifice and of communion through partaking of fleshand bluud, finds it difficult to appreciate the sincerity of a faithwhich believes in bluudless offerings and in the venerationof a sacred animal. A cynical Hindu might say, on the otherhand, that the only calf we venerate is a golden one.litnu fon lud bom nem amo​</h2><br />

Evaluate elements that needed to be changed.</h2><br />
                        <p>The Filipino moral identity is strongly based on core values such as respect for authority, resilience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. Through my own moral experiences, I have seen that these qualities are held in high regard within the Filipino community. While they can be positive traits that encourage positive behaviors, they can also be limiting when it comes to innovation or seeking alternative perspectives. I think that in order for Filipinos to be successful, it is important for them to expand their horizons by embracing new ideas and learning from different cultures. In this way, Filipinos can learn from other cultures while still retaining their core values. Additionally, I believe there needs to be a shift in the focus from success and achievement to balance and well-being in order to promote healthier life choices and relationships with one another.</p><br />

                            19. Identify and analyze crucial qualitie of the Filipino moral identity in your own moral experience. Evaluate element that needed to be changed.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Filipino moral identity is strongly based on core values such as respect for authority, resilience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. Through my own moral experiences, I have seen that these qualities are held in high regard within the Filipino community. While they can be positive traits that encourage positive behaviors, they can also be limiting when it comes to innovation or seeking alternative perspectives. I think that in order for Filipinos to be successful, it is important for them to expand their horizons by embracing new ideas and learning from different cultures. In this way, Filipinos can learn from other cultures while still retaining their core values. Additionally, I believe there needs to be a shift in the focus from success and achievement to balance and well-being in order to promote healthier life choices and relationships with one another.</p><br />

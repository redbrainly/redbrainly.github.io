                                            The Last Letter from Your Lover
Questions and Topics for Discussion
1. What similarities are there between Ellie and Jennifer? How do their experiences reflect their
respective eras? Of the two women, with whom do you empathize or identify the most?
2. Have you ever written or received a love letter? Have you ever sent a romantic e-mail or text?
Do you think electronic communication has changed the nature of expression? How does the
emotional weight of a love letter compare with that of spoken words?
3. Does Laurence love Jennifer? Imagine yourself in his position. What were his motives in lying to
Jennifer about 'Hare's death?
4. How did your opinion of O'Hare develop over the course of the novel? Is he a traditional
romantic hero?
5. If Jennifer and O'Hare had run away together, what would their lives have been like?
6. Jennifer's friends and her mother are reluctant to tell her much about her life before the accident,
urging her to focus on the future. Why? Do you believe they knew about her affair?
7. Why does Yvonne react the way she does to Jennifer's decision to leave Laurence?
8. Think of Jennifer's many roles as mother, daughter, wife, lover, and friend. Is it possible to fill all
those roles at once? Should any one role be a priority and, if so, which one? With this in mind, did
Jennifer make the right choice in pursuing O'Hare?
9. Examine the female friendships in the novel, particularly the interactions between Ellie and her
girlfriends. Had you been friends with Ellie, what advice would you have given her about John?
What would you say to John?
10. Rory argues that being in love doesn't excuse someone from being responsible for their actions,
that "everyone makes a choice" to do either the right or the wrong thing (page 332). Ellie disagrees,
believing that people can be swept away by emotion. What do you think?
11. Did you find the ending satisfactory? What happens next for Jennifer and Ellie?</a>

They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.</p><p></p><p>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</p><p></p><p>9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”</p><p></p><p>11 “No one, sir,” she said.</p><p></p><p>“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:<br /></strong>((the answer is in the pic))</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hewo po Hope this helps you! &lt;33<br /><br />have a good day!!</p><br />

                            7. The Last Letter from Your Lover
Questions and Topics for Discussion
1. What similarities are there between Ellie and Jennifer? How do their experiences reflect their
respective eras? Of the two women, with whom do you empathize or identify the most?
2. Have you ever written or received a love letter? Have you ever sent a romantic e-mail or text?
Do you think electronic communication has changed the nature of expression? How does the
emotional weight of a love letter compare with that of spoken words?
3. Does Laurence love Jennifer? Imagine yourself in his position. What were his motives in lying to
Jennifer about 'Hare's death?
4. How did your opinion of O'Hare develop over the course of the novel? Is he a traditional
romantic hero?
5. If Jennifer and O'Hare had run away together, what would their lives have been like?
6. Jennifer's friends and her mother are reluctant to tell her much about her life before the accident,
urging her to focus on the future. Why? Do you believe they knew about her affair?
7. Why does Yvonne react the way she does to Jennifer's decision to leave Laurence?
8. Think of Jennifer's many roles as mother, daughter, wife, lover, and friend. Is it possible to fill all
those roles at once? Should any one role be a priority and, if so, which one? With this in mind, did
Jennifer make the right choice in pursuing O'Hare?
9. Examine the female friendships in the novel, particularly the interactions between Ellie and her
girlfriends. Had you been friends with Ellie, what advice would you have given her about John?
What would you say to John?
10. Rory argues that being in love doesn't excuse someone from being responsible for their actions,
that "everyone makes a choice" to do either the right or the wrong thing (page 332). Ellie disagrees,
believing that people can be swept away by emotion. What do you think?
11. Did you find the ending satisfactory? What happens next for Jennifer and Ellie?</h2><br />

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

sadness and loss of interest. It is also called major depressive disorder
or clinical depression. It affects how you feel, think, and behave and
can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have
trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel
as if life is not worth living.

First, you need to prepare 14 liters of water in a basin. Second, add
and dilute APOC 2 completely. Third, add the desired colorant. Fourth,
add sodium chloride until it is completely dissolved. Fifth, add bubble
enhancer, the desired scent and antibac. Then, mix it thoroughly.
Lastly, set it aside for 24 hours before storing in an airtight bottle.
____4. The Department of Health strongly urges the public to observe the
following protective measures: To stay home during coronavirus
pandemic to better control the pandemic. Maintain at least 1-meter
distance between yourself and others because when someone coughs,
sneezes, or speaks he/she sprays small liquid droplets from his/her
nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
the disease. DOH also advises the people to practice frequent and
proper handwashing. Wash hands only with soap and water for at least
20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are
not available. Avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals, and
products that come from animals such as uncooked meat and ensure
that food is well-cooked.
____5. Marikina is known as the "Shoe Capital of the Philippines" for its
famous shoe industry. It is the biggest manufacturer of shoes in
the Philippines, producing almost 70% of shoes made in the country. It
is also the home of the world’s largest pair of shoes certified by the
Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro
Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the
country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

                                            1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</a>

By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

Romulo I talked with and write about such men as Colin Kelly, Jr, who sank the 29,000-ton battleship off Luzon, and First Lieutenant Boyd D. Wagner who was attacked by five pursuit planes at Aparri and brought down two of them in the air. Boys like these represented the heroic, helpless stand we were putting up against Japan. But there were humbler figures no less heroic, There was the little Filipino telephone girl in San Fernado, La Union, who refused to leave her switchboard and maintained communication to the last against the oncoming Japanese; and that frail school teacher in Vigan, Ilocos Sur - his name is Buenaventura J. Bello - who refused to remove the American flag from his classroom wall and was shot standing beneath it by Japanese soldiers. My brother-in-law, Alfredo Eugenio, the National Air Raid warden, when I found time to visit him in the hospital, seemed to me a courageous figure.He has taken his air raid duties seriously and burned both hands experimenting with phosphorus. His wife sat beside him night and day, manipulating the phones through which Alfredo issued the signals that kept the city warned of enemy planes. I was a soldier. I learned to work day and night sustained by the catnaps and by sandwiches and coffee wolfed at my desk. I learned how to raise my voice on the telephone so that it could be heard above the exploding bombs. Did I have a home-empty now, in the residential district and a wife and children, hiding in the provinces from the enemy while Christmas was coming on? Source: Ricabar, R. (2005).

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

SITUATION: "At the rate our people are bombarded with all sorts of Western pop and commercial music through radio, television, jukeboxes, record players, and movies-the day may not be too far away when we shall have committed our own native music to the grave; harshly forgotten, abandoned, its beauty laid to waste by an unknowing generation whose only fault is not having been given the chance to cultivate a love of it..."-Felipe Padilla de Leon Our young people hear almost nothing of the creative music of the people of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The vast output of our serious composers, who ironically are mostly Manila-based, is also unknown to them. There is a pressing need to bring Philippine music closer to our people: strong identification of our own music is one vital factor in bringing our people together or unifying the nation. Exposing Filipinos to their own musical traditions is properly the task of the government, our music educators, musicologists, community leaders, concerned media practitioners, performing groups, pro-Filipino radio and television stations and recording companies, heritage centers and libraries, and cultural organizations all over the country, As a student, you are given the task to perform music of Luzon by choosing one of the following activities listed below that you think you can do alone with confidence. 1. Sing a folk song from your region or province. You are going to sing a folk song from your region or province.

                            3. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

studied at Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a
bachelor’s degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at
the University of Sto Tomas but had to stop because he felt the Filipino
students were being discriminated by their Dominican teachers. He
went to Madrid and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid where

24.
He died on December 30, 1896 in Manila at the age of thirty- five

sadness and loss of interest. It is also called major depressive disorder
or clinical depression. It affects how you feel, think, and behave and
can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have
trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel
as if life is not worth living.

following protective measures: To stay home during coronavirus
pandemic to better control the pandemic. Maintain at least 1-meter
distance between yourself and others because when someone coughs,
sneezes, or speaks he/she sprays small liquid droplets from his/her
nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
the disease. DOH also advises the people to practice frequent and
proper handwashing. Wash hands only with soap and water for at least

Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro
Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the
country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

                            8. 1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</h2><br />

                            11. Tsinelas,
By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.
1. Who are the characters in the story?
2. What kind of student is he when he was younger?
3. What is the lesson of the story?
4. If you were the kid, do you think you would do the same? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1. Tle little boy and the mom.</strong></p><p><strong>2, He was a student filled with and ambitions and was detemined to make his dreams come true.</strong></p><p><strong>3. the lesson of the story is to never give up and always fight to reach your goal.

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />

Romulo I talked with and write about such men as Colin Kelly, Jr, who sank the 29,000-ton battleship off Luzon, and First Lieutenant Boyd D. Wagner who was attacked by five pursuit planes at Aparri and brought down two of them in the air. Boys like these represented the heroic, helpless stand we were putting up against Japan. But there were humbler figures no less heroic, There was the little Filipino telephone girl in San Fernado, La Union, who refused to leave her switchboard and maintained communication to the last against the oncoming Japanese; and that frail school teacher in Vigan, Ilocos Sur - his name is Buenaventura J. Bello - who refused to remove the American flag from his classroom wall and was shot standing beneath it by Japanese soldiers. My brother-in-law, Alfredo Eugenio, the National Air Raid warden, when I found time to visit him in the hospital, seemed to me a courageous figure.He has taken his air raid duties seriously and burned both hands experimenting with phosphorus. His wife sat beside him night and day, manipulating the phones through which Alfredo issued the signals that kept the city warned of enemy planes. I was a soldier. I learned to work day and night sustained by the catnaps and by sandwiches and coffee wolfed at my desk. I learned how to raise my voice on the telephone so that it could be heard above the exploding bombs.

                            19. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                            20. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

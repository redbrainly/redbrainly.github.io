Many were favorable, while many were having difficulty listening to the lecture and answering their modules, whether online or modulars. Face to face communication is far superior since we can speak more effectively with your classmates and professors. It allows us to spend more time together and gives us more opportunity to teach the kids about the subject. While home-based learning makes it difficult for us to speak with one another and has a restricted time for learning. Many students spend more time answering their modules than studying, which us unfortunate because the purpose we attend to school is to learn.</p><p></p><p>Teachers are also having struggling completing a modules and teaching a large number of sections or pupils, and we know that they have been responsible for the majority of the deeds the most of the time. Home-based learning also allows us to spend time with our families, and our parents provide excellent guidance in responding to our activities. However, this is also the source of much anxiety among students. Many kids may experience a mental breakdown or a hard time in their home, which causes them to lose concentration at school.</p><p></p><p>This method of learning has both benefits and drawbacks. We just do not dwell on the negative. But, at the very least, we want for the new normal to arrive so that we can prosper in our lives in the future. We may be optimistic in life and support each other academically. We may easily engage with one another and enjoy our childhood development.</p><br />

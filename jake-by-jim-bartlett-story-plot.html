                        <p>1. I felt the pain and sorrow of the story, but was undeniably surprised of the ending.  The ending made me feel more grievous because it is not the plot that I expected which is remarkable indeed.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Jake was the dog of Max and Martha.  He was in a state of loneliness because Max, his best friend, died and he longs for Max’s presence.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. These are the words or phrases that helped me figure out Jake’s identity:
</p><p>…kneel down onto the carpet beside him.
</p><p>…tucks back his long, floppy ears…

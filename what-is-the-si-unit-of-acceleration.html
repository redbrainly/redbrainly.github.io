                                            There are three ways to describe motion. It can be through (1)(3) (2) In everyday language, most people use the terms "speed" and "velocity" interchangeably. Speed is the rate of motion or the rate of change of position. It is expressed as (4) unit of time. Velocity is the time rate of change of position. It is the (5) and moved per of a body per unit time. The SI unit of speed and velocity is (6)\ A body normally changes its speed while moving. (7) the total distance. (8) of a body is the total distance it traveled divided by the time spent in traveling of an object is its speed at a particular instant of time with total time extremely small. When an object's instantaneous speed values are always the same, then it means that the object is moving with (9) Where you will be and what time you will reach your destination are easily predicted when you move at a constant speed or velocity. An object's motion is constantly changing. Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.

Speed is the rate of motion or the rate of change of position. It is expressed as (4) unit of time. Velocity is the time rate of change of position. It is the (5) and moved per of a body per unit time. The SI unit of speed and velocity is (6)\ A body normally changes its speed while moving. (7) the total distance.

When an object's instantaneous speed values are always the same, then it means that the object is moving with (9) Where you will be and what time you will reach your destination are easily predicted when you move at a constant speed or velocity.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the more striking characteristics of human civilization has been his attempts to use his intelligence to seek relief from his various bodily ailments. His original efforts were entirely empirical like a game of ‘Blind Man's Buff’. There is a record of these early activities in a museum in Heidelberg which authentically recreates the official pharmacies of folk-lore medicine that operated in Germany from the 14th to the 18th centuries. In their day, these pharmacies administered the official pharmacopoeias, the currently accepted list of remedies and nostrums of the day. The museum shows how the pharmacopoeias kept changing. As products fell into disfavour, new products appeared to fill the gaps. We now know that many diseases will ameliorate for a time by giving biologically inert-substances – placebos. So, from a therapeutic point of view, were these drugs intrinsically useless? Probably most of the remedies were indeed worthless. But folk medicine had its successes; some of them are still used in modern medicine. The roots of the belladonna plant are a source of atropine, the leaves of the foxglove are a source of digitalis, and the seeds of a common poppy provide morphine. How people originally found out about the therapeutic properties of these plants is truly a mystery.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> I believe that it is necessary to show the public just how harmful illicit drugs are, and can be. Drug addiction is a chronic disease, so therefore it cannot be cured, but it can in fact be treated. Support groups and Anti drug programs are good ways to help out relapsing addicts, and young individuals. The information that I have discovered is not necessarily correct or incorrect, as what goes through an addict’s mind can only be interpreted by the addict himself. The supporting details and statistics that went along with my findings were also surprisingly accurate. What I feel needs to be changed about drug abuse and drugs in general, is more enforcement. For example, the obtainment of illicit drugs is extremely easy these days, as anyone could get their hands on them if they had the money. The DEA needs to take higher risks in shutting down younger dealers, because that is usually how minors get drugs. Without serious enforcement and serious penalties, nobody would really be willing to give into the authorities. The impact that this topic holds on me, is that many of my peers have already begun to abuse illicit drugs, and that eventually may end up coming to me. Drug addiction happens all over the world as long as there is some sort of supply in that area. You may look at someone and say, “They can’t be an addict”, but the stereotypes we have created for ourselves don’t always happen to be true. What upsets me, is that so many young people give in to the peer pressure of using drugs. When people claim that pot isn’t a drug, they are just creating more reasons for themselves to abuse more hardcore drugs like acid or ecstasy. The subject of drug addiction is something that needs to be handled now, so everybody can have an equal chance in life. I Hope You Learn Something For Me Peace :)<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Addiction has always been a part of the human condition. We have seen the devastation it is capable of, but now, more than ever, it is affecting our daily lives. With the current opioid crisis in our country, almost daily we hear about it on the news, in the latest sitcoms, in newspaper articles, during a presidential debate, or around the dinner table.</p><br />

                            3. reflection about illegal drugs</h2><br />
                        <p>The issue about illegal drugs had long been an issue for the Philippines. <strong>Efforts at stopping the rise of illegal drug users had failed because the sheer number of people involved is too much</strong>. This <strong>ingrained </strong>problem in our society will perhaps be there to stay. This means that just like poverty, it will be part of the perennial problems our government would have to tackle. At best we can reduce it, but not totally eliminate it. Below is a sample reflection about illegal drugs.
</p><p>
</p>Reflection About Illegal Drugs
<p>
</p><p>Our problem with illegal drugs had been present for the longest time. It is something that has been a thorn in the side for over several presidents now and it had not been solved just yet. There may be several complicating factors as to why this is not solved yet. Many nations where the issue of drugs are present at those states or countries that are not wealthy--so could it be possibly linked to poverty? It could be.
</p><p>
</p><p>Solving poverty is therefore a necessary step in solving the issue of drugs. We are not able to solve something that is as complex as drugs if our people are hungry all the time. They would resort to taking drugs and other crimes just to solve the issue of poverty on their own or at least forget that they have a problem with drugs.  </p><p>
</p><p>Next is the issue of catching the big drug lords. We must also make sure the drug lords are caught, and hopefully, meted out with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. But this raises another problem - the National Bilibid Prison. The national penitentiary currently serves as the center of operations of drug distribution in the country. The best way to deal with this is to isolate the drug lords in an island without electricity or food supply--where they would be forced to work for their own food and survival for the rest of their lives--that way, they would not be able to deal drugs again.
</p><p>
</p><p>With the issue of regular people being involved, it is best that rehabilitation be carried out more effectively. Cognitive behavior therapy must be employed to reform the drug addicts and drug dealers. They also must be given a way to integrate into the society once they are fully-reformed and any sign of relapse should result in immediate confinement in a rehab facility.  </p><p></p><p>Barangay officers must likewise be part of the solution. When I think of it, intelligence gathering really starts at the barangay level. The base structure of our government is highly critical in providing information to our state agencies like PDEA. Society integration , for those rehabilitated would also begin at the barangay level. I have also seen barangay officers warn drug addicts of an impending raid , making them scamper away--something that contravenes what the national government wants.</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see, this would take concerted efforts and it will be very difficult to solve the problem, but it does not mean it could not be done with the help of every stakeholder.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thousands of people in the Philippines have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte launched his “war on drugs” on June 30, 2016, the day he took office. Among those who died have been dozens of children under age 18 who were either specifically targeted or were inadvertently shot during anti-drug raids, what authorities have called “collateral damage.” Philippine children’s rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) put the total number of child fatalities at 101 from July 2016 through December 2018, both targeted and killed as bystanders. More deaths of children have been reported in the media in 2019 and 2020.</p><p></p><p>More broadly, official figures from the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency put the number of “drug war” casualties at 5,601 deaths as of January 31, 2020. In virtually every case, police claimed they killed a drug seller or user during a raid after the suspect resisted arrest and fought back. The national Commission on Human Rights and domestic human rights groups believe many thousands more – estimated at more than 27,000 – have been killed by the police, agents of the police, or unidentified assailants.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa Brainlist po!</p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />

                            6. write a reflection about the topics discussed during the drug symposium last november 17 2021</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Life has its own ups and downs but using kinds of substances was never a solution and would create more problems. Drugs has always been a mainstream in the society that keeps on reminding us that we should never try on using these to be better or to keep us sane because its dangerous. And it shows on the statistics or in the news how it affect us human beings that it destruct our way of thinking. We should care about ourselves and if we are not on our right mind, we should try asking help in our relationships or in the professionals. Using drugs is never the solution to solve our problems or to make the world better. Drugs is never an escape in reality rather it would make you worse in dealing your life. Try to ask for help and keep on going even in your worst state and life might give you a lesson in fighting and that would be worth it. However, many people use a person's state of vulnerability to make business with them in selling drugs. I abhor this idea of business in spreading drugs because these group of people only thinks about money and themselves and not even the victims of drugs they have been selling to. It was an injustice so the victims should really have been careful in buying these substances. But we are only human beings and being weak on many things and wanted only to breathe again or to rest and many will then use us in our most vulnerability.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Sana makatulong and merry chrismast to all brainly user</p><br />

REFLECTION
BUSE </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have learned that drug use, misuse, abuse, and dependence are all related concepts that refer to different ways in which people interact with drugs. Drug use refers to the consumption of drugs for medical or recreational purposes, while drug misuse refers to the incorrect or inappropriate use of drugs. Drug abuse, on the other hand, refers to the harmful or excessive use of drugs, and can lead to negative consequences for the individual and those around them. Drug dependence, meanwhile, is a state in which a person becomes physically and psychologically reliant on a drug and has difficulty functioning without it.</p><p></p><p>Through my reflection on these concepts, I have come to understand the potential dangers of drug use and the need to be informed and careful when it comes to drugs. I have also gained empathy for those who may be struggling with drug abuse or dependence, and recognize the importance of seeking help and support for those who need it. These concepts have also made me more aware of the potential impact of drugs on my own life and the lives of those around me, and have reinforced the importance of making informed and responsible decisions when it comes to drug use.</p><p></p><p><strong>I hope I helped, Godbless :)</strong></p><br />

                        In someways, the way President Rodrigo Duterte treats drug addicts can be of a advantage or it could have benefits. This is because, people who use drugs becomes afraid. Usually, if people feel fear, they stop what they are doing and that is exactly what is happening now. People are scared that they might get killed that is why they stop using the illegal substances. Although there are advantages for some people like the police and others, there are also disadvantages for thw victims. This is because some policemen just shoots without even confirming if the suspect is really an addict or not.<br />

                            22. reflective essay about drug abuse​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My reflection paper is on the subject of substance abuse.  As the structure of society changes, the acceptability of one drug or another changes.  I have dealt with my own experiences of substance abuse personally and through family and friends throughout my community.  I believe there are many underlying problems Native people face today that lead to substance abuse.  So, drug use and alcoholism is not the problem in my town, those are more like side effects of something deeper.  I would have to agree most with the symbolic interactionist perspective as far as the labeling theory goes.  There are also many images in the media that depict the use of drugs and alcohol to make it seem like even though it is bad, it is sometimes okay.  These images sparked my own curiosity to experience a fun high or a night out with friends and hopefully getting lucky.  I had so many questions about drug use and alcohol.  My older siblings and cousins were involved in those circles so it was only natural that me and my cousins and peers who I grew up with got into smoking marijuana and buying drinks on the weekends.  I did not know at the time about the dangers of underage drinking.  I also had very little knowledge of the condition of my mental health at my young age.  Eventually I found out that I had an addictive personality and I got myself into a downward spiral of substance abuse. My drug of choice is marijuana.  Some people say marijuana is not a drug.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

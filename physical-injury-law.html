One time, past midnight and it was raining so hard, Paolo Konti went downstairs with a loaded gun to investigate what he thought were footsteps of an uninvited guest. Paolo asked- “Sino yan?” for two times.  No one replied. After seeing what appeared to him an armed stranger looking around and out to rob the house, he fired his gun seriously injuring the man.  When the lights were turned on, the unfortunate victim turned out to be his father-in-law who is on his way to the kitchen to get a glass of water. Paolo was indicted for serious physical injuries. Should Paolo, given the circumstances, be convicted or acquitted? Why?​</a>

Scientists use the scientific method in their research, but it is also used by people who aren’t scientists in everyday life. Even if you were not consciously aware of it, you have used the scientific method many times when solving problems around you. For example, say you are at home and a lightbulb goes out. Noticing that the lightbulb is out is an observation. You would then naturally question, “Why is the lightbulb out?” and come up with possible guesses, or hypotheses. For example, you may hypothesize that the bulb has burned out. Then you would perform a very small experiment in order to test your hypothesis; namely, you would replace the bulb and analyze the data (“Did the light come back on?”). If the light turned back on, you would conclude that the lightbulb had, in fact, burned out. But if the light still did not work, you would come up with other hypotheses (“The socket doesn’t work”, “Part of the lamp is broken,” “The fuse went out”, etc.) and test those.</a>

This kind of research derives conclusion from observations and manifestations that already occurred in the past and now compared to some dependent variables.4. It describes the norm level of characteristics for a given behavior.5. in this design, the researcher can collect more data, either by scheduling more observations or finding more existing measures.6. It is conducted by researchers whose aim would be to find out the direction, associations and/or relationship between different variables or groups of respondents under study. 7. It refers to the overall strategy that you choose in order to integrate the different components of the study in acoherent and logical way, thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. 8. It controls for both time-related and group-related threats. Two features mark true experiments: two or more differently treated groups; and random assignment to these groups.9. All variables in the study can contribute to the over-all prediction in an equation that adds together power of each identified variable.10. Its main purpose is to observe, describe and document aspects of a situation as it naturally occurs and sometimes to serve as a starting point for hypothesis generation or theory development.​</a>

                                            ASSIMILATION: 4-5. Learning Task 3: KNOW THY PARTS A. Direction: Identify in which section of an academic paper each of these extracts is likely to appear. The research indicated that 1. even when participants were told that all food options were artificially colored; they still chose savory food that looked 'natural" rather than food dyed blue. This suggests that adults have preference for food colors that look natural. However, blue is not a color associated with food; this might have distorted the results. 2. To sum, the research claims that adults do not select savory foods dyed blue if given the choice of other options of dyed food. The 'novelty effect of blue products, suggested by previous research, did not hold true for savory food. The research found out that people choose savory food on a different basis to sweet food. 3. Firstly, participants were told that all the food were colored using artificial dyes. Each person was then allowed to choose three items to eat. This meant they could not select one of each color. A record was kept of the colors selected by each person. The results were then calculated according to food color preferences overall and preferences by gender. It has been argued that diet can be affected by the color of food. Research have shown that some people have strong aversions to certain food color combinations. People were less likely to eat food if they disliked that color combination. Dee (1994) found that food color preferences are affected by age, with green being the least popular food coloring among children. B. Assessment: Multiple Choice.

Write it on a separate sheet of paper. Scientists use the scientific method in their research, but it is also used by people who aren’t scientists in everyday life. Even if you were not consciously aware of it, you have used the scientific method many times when solving problems around you. For example, say you are at home and a lightbulb goes out. Noticing that the lightbulb is out is an observation. You would then naturally question, “Why is the lightbulb out?” and come up with possible guesses, or hypotheses. For example, you may hypothesize that the bulb has burned out. Then you would perform a very small experiment in order to test your hypothesis; namely, you would replace the bulb and analyze the data (“Did the light come back on?”). If the light turned back on, you would conclude that the lightbulb had, in fact, burned out. But if the light still did not work, you would come up with other hypotheses (“The socket doesn’t work”, “Part of the lamp is broken,” “The fuse went out”, etc.) and test those.</a>

Many crocodiles have died because people dried up theswamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodileshave been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, peoplemust take care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.7.

The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawingincorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one ofseveral possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion10. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, andend with a conclusion that is based on evidence. Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation.Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis. Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. Step 4 is to think aboutthe findings--think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion.​</a>

Scientists use the scientific method in their research, but it is also used by people who aren’t scientists in everyday life. Even if you were not consciously aware of it, you have used the scientific method many times when solving problems around you. For example, say you are at home and a lightbulb goes out. Noticing that the lightbulb is out is an observation. You would then naturally question, “Why is the lightbulb out?” and come up with possible guesses, or hypotheses. For example, you may hypothesize that the bulb has burned out. Then you would perform a very small experiment in order to test your hypothesis; namely, you would replace the bulb and analyze the data (“Did the light come back on?”). If the light turned back on, you would conclude that the lightbulb had, in fact, burned out. But if the light still did not work, you would come up with other hypotheses (“The socket doesn’t work”, “Part of the lamp is broken,” “The fuse went out”, etc.) and test those.</h2><br />

                            12. ASSIMILATION: 4-5. Learning Task 3: KNOW THY PARTS A. Direction: Identify in which section of an academic paper each of these extracts is likely to appear. The research indicated that 1. even when participants were told that all food options were artificially colored; they still chose savory food that looked 'natural" rather than food dyed blue. This suggests that adults have preference for food colors that look natural. However, blue is not a color associated with food; this might have distorted the results. 2. To sum, the research claims that adults do not select savory foods dyed blue if given the choice of other options of dyed food. The 'novelty effect of blue products, suggested by previous research, did not hold true for savory food. The research found out that people choose savory food on a different basis to sweet food. 3. Firstly, participants were told that all the food were colored using artificial dyes. Each person was then allowed to choose three items to eat. This meant they could not select one of each color. A record was kept of the colors selected by each person. The results were then calculated according to food color preferences overall and preferences by gender. It has been argued that diet can be affected by the color of food. Research have shown that some people have strong aversions to certain food color combinations. People were less likely to eat food if they disliked that color combination. Dee (1994) found that food color preferences are affected by age, with green being the least popular food coloring among children. B. Assessment: Multiple Choice.

The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawingincorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one ofseveral possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion10. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, andend with a conclusion that is based on evidence. Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation.Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis. Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. Step 4 is to think aboutthe findings--think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion.​</h2><br />

                            2. opinion about typhoon (ESSAY)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Have we learned from the avoidable mistakes made in past disasters? Are we prepared to effectively handle any emergencies that might happen in the coming days? Can the government coordinate well with other sectors in responding to all possible situations? (READ: What gov't has done so far to prepare for Typhoon Ompong)  </p><p>
</p><p>It has been nearly 9 years since the onslaught of Typhoon Ondoy in Metro Manila, yet memories of extreme flooding and strong winds remain vivid among those affected by the disaster. The unprecedented devastation it brought to the nation’s capital and surrounding provinces led to climate change becoming fully integrated into national and local policymaking. Laws such as the Climate Change Act of 2009 and the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Act of 2010 were institutionalized to ensure better management of and response to disasters.  </p><p>
</p><p>Have we learned our lessons?  </p><p>
</p><p>Yet the following years saw different parts of the Philippines suffer losses and damage to one extreme event after another. Super typhoons, El Niño-enhanced droughts, and monsoon rains left communities struggling to fully recover from their impacts. Some rehabilitation efforts, most notably those affected by Yolanda in Eastern Visayas, remain uneven or unfinished to this day.  </p><p>
</p><p>Truth be told, improvements have been made in our preparedness for natural hazards. New equipment for PAGASA has allowed improvements in weather forecasting and modeling climate change. Early warning systems and communicating climate and disaster-related information to the public have also seen progress in the past decade. Some regional DRRM Councils have even initiated projects to reduce disaster risks in their areas and increase the resilience of their constituencies.  </p><p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, glaring problems in the national and local DRRM remain evident. A lack of sufficient manpower and financial and technical resources hinder the implementation of programs throughout the DRRM framework. Awareness in dealing with disasters remains low in some regions, partially worsened by corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. Some government agencies even refuse to provide necessary data for planning against disasters to other agencies or civil society organizations.  (READ: EXPLAINER: Who's supposed to be in charge during disasters?)
</p><p>
</p><p>The most significant of these problems is the focus of governance on responding to disasters instead of prevention and mitigation. Despite improvements in its capacity and its importance in preventing disasters, the science and technology sector remains underfunded and underappreciated. Poor land-use planning and ineffective building codes repeatedly expose the most vulnerable sectors, including the urban poor and the marginalized, to the worst of such impacts. (READ: Expert: PH tech, understanding of disasters 'on par with world's best')  </p><p>
</p><p>While more avenues for climate change adaptation-based support have opened in recent years, local government units are either unaware of the availability of these options or unsure of how to access these much-needed resources. Specifically, LGUs are not familiar with engaging with academic institutions in coming up with proposals to get support. (READ: Disaster imagination: 3 steps toward disaster preparedness)  </p><p>
</p><p>Political will, effective leadership  </p><p>
</p><p>These are the issues that House Bill 8165, which seeks to create the Department of Disaster Resilience, attempts to address. The resulting super-agency will lead the national coordination of efforts for reducing the risks, preparing for the impacts of hazards, and rehabilitating should disasters occur. The bill also attempts to streamline disaster risk reduction management and climate change adaptation planning to enhance implementation efficiency.  (READ: Duterte sends Cabinet members to Luzon provinces in Ompong's path)
</p><p>
</p><p>The need for enhancing our DRRM framework is undisputable, given the endorsement of President Duterte, the recent history of damages inflicted by tropical cyclones, and projected worsening climate change impacts. Modifying the systems in place cannot be done overnight but the urgency of the problem requires immediate action.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
There must be adequate manpower and funding for all aspects of DRRM, but efforts on disaster prevention and mitigation must be prioritized. In this regard, the government should engage and coordinate with the private sector, civil society organizations, the academe, and local communities to minimize, if not avoid altogether, loss and damage to extreme events.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The typhoon affected living creatures and properties. People, animals, and plants can be killed during typhoon. First, flooding can be the reasons for humans to get drown because of a high level of water. The bad weather can also give them sickness such as fever, common cold and malaria, which is a serious infectious disease spread by certain mosquitoes. A few of them suffered from trauma after the typhoon. Trauma is a type of damage to the mind that causes a person to be precisely afraid of something.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Buildings and Infrastructure The two most destructive forces associated with typhoons are wind and rain. According to the Green Fun website, typhoon winds can affect buildings and other structures in two ways: through direct force and through projectiles. Direct force is when a wind gust Islams directly into a building or structure and causes physical damage, such as when wind blows the roof off a home. Wind can also inflict damage by picking up and launching debris and other items, such as tree branches and building materials, into buildings and other structures. The heavy and persistent rainfall that typhoons bring can also have devastating effects.</p><br />

If you have not been ordered to evacuate, stay in a safe area or shelter during a natural disaster. In your home, a safe area may be a ground floor interior room, closet or bathroom. Be sure you have access to your survival kit in case you are in an emergency event that lasts several days.
Listen to your portable radio for important updates and instructions from local authorities. Remember to have a battery-powered radio in your survival kit. Some radios are now equipped with multiple power sources, such as batteries, solar panels and a hand crank.If power is lost, use a generator with caution. Make sure conditions are safe before operating a portable generator. Only operate it outside — away from windows, doors or vents. Follow all manufacturer’s instructions.
Stay in your safe area and do not drive until the danger has passed. Resist the temptation to check on your property until you are sure it is safe to do so.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>tama sa ttas</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

It represents one of the Pacific basin's fastest-ever rapid intensifications. The eyewall of Super Typhoon Noru, which has maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h and gustiness of up to 240 km/h, is currently impacting the Polillo Islands, <strong>according to PAGASA</strong>, the weather bureau for the Philippines (10-min interval). Later tonight, it is anticipated to make landfall in Quezon Province or Aurora Province in central Luzon's densely populated area.</p><p>According to PAGASA, it is also becoming more likely that the storm would maintain typhoon strength once it crosses Luzon's mainland. The highest possible Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal (TCWS) No. 5 (185 km/h or more) has been issued over parts of the Polillo Islands in the provinces of Quezon, Bulacan, and Pampanga, and there is a significant risk of storm surge in the exposed and low-lying coastal areas. Marikina, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, Valenzuela, and Quezon City are among the areas of Metro Manila that are currently subject to TCWS No. 4 (118-184 km/h), while the remainder of the area is under TCWS No. 3 (89-117 km/h).</p><p></p><p>For another essay about Typhoon Karding, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29771720</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Typhoons can have a significant impact on communities, causing damage to homes and businesses, as well as disruptions to essential services.</p><p></p><p><strong>Body</strong>: The aftermath of a typhoon can be difficult for people to cope with, both emotionally and financially. Typhoon relief efforts are often needed in order to help the community recover from such an event. </p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the effect of a typhoon can be devastating, communities can often rebound with the help of relief efforts.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoons, also known as tropical cyclones, are powerful storms that can have a significant impact on communities. These storms can bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding, which can lead to damage to homes and infrastructure, power outages, and disruptions to daily life. In some cases, typhoons can even cause loss of life.</p><p></p><p>The effects of a typhoon on a community can be devastating. Strong winds can cause damage to homes and buildings, and heavy rainfall can lead to flooding, which can wash away homes and roads, disrupt transportation, and make it difficult for emergency services to reach those in need. The destruction of homes and infrastructure can leave people homeless, and without access to basic needs like food and water. The economic impact can also be significant, as businesses may be forced to close, and agricultural land may be destroyed, leading to food shortages and loss of livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>Communities that are particularly vulnerable, such as low-income neighborhoods, and those located in low-lying areas, are at higher risk of suffering severe damage from typhoons. Also, the people living in these areas are more likely to be affected by the storm's aftermath, as they may lack the resources to rebuild or the capacity to cope with the trauma of the event.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to note that proper planning and preparedness can help mitigate the effects of a typhoon on a community. This includes having an evacuation plan in place, providing emergency shelters, and having an adequate supply of food and water. Governments and other organizations can also invest in infrastructure projects that can help protect communities from typhoons, such as building sea walls or improving drainage systems.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, typhoons can have a significant impact on communities, causing damage to homes and infrastructure, power outages, and disruptions to daily life. However, with proper planning and preparedness, the effects of these storms can be mitigated, and communities can be better prepared to cope with the aftermath. It is important for governments and organizations to work together to protect communities from typhoons and to help them recover. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest please</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoons bring strong winds and heavy rains resulting in flooding, great damage to crops, houses and buildings, and death due to accidents. Climate change affects the increase in the intensity of typhoons.Their effects range from structural damage to trees, watercraft, and buildings to both immediate and long-term impacts on human life and livelihood.</p>The typhoon affected living creatures and properties. People, animals, and plants can be killed during typhoon. First, flooding can be the reasons for humans to get drown because of a high level of water. The bad weather can also give them sickness such as fever, common cold and malaria, which is a serious infectious disease spread by certain mosquitoes. A few of them suffered from trauma after the typhoon. Trauma is a type of damage to the mind that causes a person to be precisely afraid of something.Buildings and Infrastructure The two most destructive forces associated with typhoons are wind and rain. According to the Green Fun website, typhoon winds can affect buildings and other structures in two ways: through direct force and through projectiles. Direct force is when a wind gust Islams directly into a building or structure and causes physical damage, such as when wind blows the roof off a home. Wind can also inflict damage by picking up and launching debris and other items, such as tree branches and building materials, into buildings and other structures. The heavy and persistent rainfall that typhoons bring can also have devastating effects.<p></p><br />

The country has implemented a number of disaster risk management strategies in order to reduce the damage caused by typhoons.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important strategies is the early warning system. This system is designed to provide timely and accurate information to the public about impending storms, allowing people to evacuate and take other safety measures. The government has also implemented a number of disaster preparedness programs, such as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, which outlines the steps to be taken to mitigate the effects of disasters. This plan includes measures such as the construction of evacuation centers, the establishment of early warning systems, and the implementation of disaster risk reduction measures.</p><p></p><p>The government has also taken steps to improve the response to typhoons. For example, the Philippine Red Cross has been providing relief and assistance to those affected by typhoons since the 1950s. The government has also increased the number of search and rescue teams and has provided additional funding for disaster relief efforts.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the government has implemented a number of measures to reduce the risk of typhoons. These include the strengthening of coastal areas, the construction of flood control systems, and the implementation of land-use policies that limit the destruction of mangroves and other coastal ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines has made great strides in reducing the risk of typhoons and their effects. However, there is still much work to be done. The government must continue to invest in disaster risk reduction and management strategies, and ensure that these strategies are implemented effectively. It is also important to educate the public on the importance of disaster preparedness and the steps they can take to protect themselves and their families. By doing so, the Philippines can continue to reduce the risk of typhoons and their devastating effects.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps po</p><br />

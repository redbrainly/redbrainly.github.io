                            9. Using the eight stages of food service cycle as a framework, visit and collect information about the three different types of food and beverages operation. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Food and beverage operations
</p><p>Food and beverage (or food service) operations are concerned with the provision of food and a variety of beverages within business. The international food
</p><p>service industry provides millions of meals a day in a wide variety of types of
</p><p>food service operation.
</p><p>For managers in food and beverage operations, skills in marketing, merchandising, staff management, team development, training, customer relations, financial management and operational management are necessary for the management
</p><p>of both the service sequence (delivery) and the customer process (experience),
</p><p>and ultimately for the survival of the business.
</p><p>The various elements that make up a food and beverage operation can be
</p><p>summarised into the eight stages of the Food Service Cycle. The eight stages
</p><p>follow a logical sequence from determining the market needs that the operation
</p><p>is intended to meet, through to checking whether this is actually being achieved,
</p><p>as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Food service operations are therefore concerned with:
</p><p>1 Consumers and the market: the existing and future consumer needs and the
</p><p>potential market being served by the operation.
</p><p>2 Policy and objectives: guiding the choice of the operational methods that are
</p><p>used.
</p><p>3 Customer service specification: decisions on the range and type of menu and
</p><p>beverage lists to be provided, as well as other services, and the service levels
</p><p>to be offered and the prices to be charged.
</p><p>4 Facilities: the planning and design, and operational capability of the facilities,
</p><p>plant and equipment to support the customer service specification.
</p><p>5 Purchasing: developing purchasing, storage and stock control methods to
</p><p>meet the needs of the food production, beverage provision and other services
</p><p>being provided.
</p><p>6 Production and service: using efficient food production and food and beverage service methods to support the requirements of the customer service
</p><p>specification.
</p><p>7 Control of costs and revenue: maintaining robust systems for the accounting
</p><p>of revenue and the monitoring of costs of materials, labour and overheads.
</p><p>8 Monitoring of customer satisfaction: regular checking on the extent to which
</p><p>the operation is meeting customer needs and achieving customer satisfaction.
</p><p>The food service cycle is not just a statement of what food and beverage operations
</p><p>are concerned with. It also provides a comprehensive framework for the planning
</p><p>of a new food and beverage operation, as well as the appraisal of existing ones.<strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

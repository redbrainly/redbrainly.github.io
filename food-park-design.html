Ibigay ang inyong reaksiyon sa pamamagitan nang pagsulat ng sanaysay na nagpapatunay na ang Community Pantry ay isang gawaing nagpapaunlad ng ispiritwalidad ng bawat tao.Community pantry. Mabuting virus ng kabutihan na kumalat sa buong bansa Nitong Abril 14, naglabas ang 26-anyos na al Ana Patricia Non, Isang furniture designer, ng kawayana lalaayan at nagkabit ng dalawang karatula sa isang puno sa tapat ng bang dating food park sa bahagi ng Maginhawa Street sa Quezon City. Mababasa sa unang karatula ang: Maginhawa Community Pantry. Habang paglala naman ang nasa ikalawa: "Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan, kumuha batay sa pangangalianaan, Mula sa paunang suplay ng gulay, Ilog, bigas at mag de lata, bumuhos ang mag nagbibigay nang biskuwit, malinom, gamot at iba pang basikana pangangailangan. Matapos niyang ibahagi ang inisyatibong ito sa social media, ang simpleng Ideya ay tinulad na rin sa ibang lugar sa Metro Manila at sa maraming bahagi ng bansa. Tinularan ito ni Mana Tootz ng P. Noval na sinundan din ng pagtatayo ng pantry nl Mara de Guzman sa Parang, Marikina, sa pagsasabing naging inspirasyon niya sina Anna at Mang Toots. Ganito rin ang nangyari sa Caloocan na itinayo sa San Roque Cathedral: na finaluran sa Plaza Roma sa harap ng Manila Cathedral sa Maynila. Mula Pampangan, Bulacan at Laguna, tumalon ang ideya sa Occidental Mindoro, sa Boracay, at hanggang sa katimugan ng bansa sa Purok 5. Canumay, Iligan City. Nitong Linggo, ibinahagi niya ang kanyang pananaw sa lingguhang programa sa radyo ni Vice President Leni Robredo. "Malapit po sa sikmura" (it's a gut issue) pagbabahagi ni Non, bilang sagot kung bakit sa palagay niya ay mabis na kumalat at lumawak ang gawain. Bagamat nagpahayag siya ng kasiyahan sa naging pangyayari, nakaramdam din siya ng kalungkutan "kasi evident na talaga na kulang ang mga nakukuha ng mag fao," marahil bilang pagtukoy sa ayuda o pinansiyal na tulong na nagmumula sa pamahalaan. Pinuri ning Senador Juan Edgardo Angara at Panfilo Lacson at Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque ang naging pagpapamalas ng mga Pilipino ng bayanihan. Hinikayat ni Angara ang gobyemo, mga lokal na pamahalaan at pribadong sektor "to replicate and even scale up these community pantries to cater to even more people." Hindi naman kasing positibo ang pananaw ni Lacson, na nagsabing nararamdaman niyang nagiging "desperado" na ang mga tao sa kakayahan ng pamahalaan na matulungan sila, isang sentimento ng binanggit din ni dating Vice President Jejomar Binay na nagsabing: "When the situation seems hopeless, we can lift each other's spirit. Maatulungan, magtiwala sa isa't-isa, at manala sa Maykapal." Naobserbahan ni Non na maraming tao ang gustong makatulong ngunit hindi sila makahanap ng tamang lugar para maibahagi ang ito. "Hindi naman kallangan magarbong effort para makatulong," aniya, "kahit sa simpleng paraan lang." Batid na ang inisyatibong ito ay hindi magiging solusyon sa kagutuman at kahirapan, sinabi niyang mainam na makalwas man lamang ang mga tao mula sa pamamalimos o pag-utang. Tinatanaw rin niya ang isang senaryo pagkatapos ng pandemya, kung saan maaaring muling magkita-kita at kumain ang mga tao sa Maginhawa (isang lugar ng kariwasaan, kaginhawaan at pahinga).​</a>

                                            27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</a>

Encircle the letter of the correct answer.Residents of the Central Park area look with alarm at the diabolical plot to change a beautiful spot into a baseball park. If this malicious plan is carried out, the lovely trees in the park will be chopped down. Values of the property within the area will drop sharply as the park fills with the filth and debris of the bulldozers and other equipment.

Invariably, new cars need parts replaced almost as soon as the warranty expires. Unfortunately, people need transportation, so they continue to buy new automobiles. The author shows bias against…	A. new car owners				C. car repair shops	B. foreign car manufacturers			D. automobile manufacturersEveryone who cooks should own a food processor.

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

                            4. Panuto: Basahin ang balita sa kahon. Ibigay ang inyong reaksiyon sa pamamagitan nang pagsulat ng sanaysay na nagpapatunay na ang Community Pantry ay isang gawaing nagpapaunlad ng ispiritwalidad ng bawat tao.Community pantry. Mabuting virus ng kabutihan na kumalat sa buong bansa Nitong Abril 14, naglabas ang 26-anyos na al Ana Patricia Non, Isang furniture designer, ng kawayana lalaayan at nagkabit ng dalawang karatula sa isang puno sa tapat ng bang dating food park sa bahagi ng Maginhawa Street sa Quezon City. Mababasa sa unang karatula ang: Maginhawa Community Pantry. Habang paglala naman ang nasa ikalawa: "Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan, kumuha batay sa pangangalianaan, Mula sa paunang suplay ng gulay, Ilog, bigas at mag de lata, bumuhos ang mag nagbibigay nang biskuwit, malinom, gamot at iba pang basikana pangangailangan. Matapos niyang ibahagi ang inisyatibong ito sa social media, ang simpleng Ideya ay tinulad na rin sa ibang lugar sa Metro Manila at sa maraming bahagi ng bansa. Tinularan ito ni Mana Tootz ng P. Noval na sinundan din ng pagtatayo ng pantry nl Mara de Guzman sa Parang, Marikina, sa pagsasabing naging inspirasyon niya sina Anna at Mang Toots. Ganito rin ang nangyari sa Caloocan na itinayo sa San Roque Cathedral: na finaluran sa Plaza Roma sa harap ng Manila Cathedral sa Maynila. Mula Pampangan, Bulacan at Laguna, tumalon ang ideya sa Occidental Mindoro, sa Boracay, at hanggang sa katimugan ng bansa sa Purok 5. Canumay, Iligan City. Nitong Linggo, ibinahagi niya ang kanyang pananaw sa lingguhang programa sa radyo ni Vice President Leni Robredo. "Malapit po sa sikmura" (it's a gut issue) pagbabahagi ni Non, bilang sagot kung bakit sa palagay niya ay mabis na kumalat at lumawak ang gawain. Bagamat nagpahayag siya ng kasiyahan sa naging pangyayari, nakaramdam din siya ng kalungkutan "kasi evident na talaga na kulang ang mga nakukuha ng mag fao," marahil bilang pagtukoy sa ayuda o pinansiyal na tulong na nagmumula sa pamahalaan. Pinuri ning Senador Juan Edgardo Angara at Panfilo Lacson at Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque ang naging pagpapamalas ng mga Pilipino ng bayanihan. Hinikayat ni Angara ang gobyemo, mga lokal na pamahalaan at pribadong sektor "to replicate and even scale up these community pantries to cater to even more people." Hindi naman kasing positibo ang pananaw ni Lacson, na nagsabing nararamdaman niyang nagiging "desperado" na ang mga tao sa kakayahan ng pamahalaan na matulungan sila, isang sentimento ng binanggit din ni dating Vice President Jejomar Binay na nagsabing: "When the situation seems hopeless, we can lift each other's spirit. Maatulungan, magtiwala sa isa't-isa, at manala sa Maykapal." Naobserbahan ni Non na maraming tao ang gustong makatulong ngunit hindi sila makahanap ng tamang lugar para maibahagi ang ito. "Hindi naman kallangan magarbong effort para makatulong," aniya, "kahit sa simpleng paraan lang." Batid na ang inisyatibong ito ay hindi magiging solusyon sa kagutuman at kahirapan, sinabi niyang mainam na makalwas man lamang ang mga tao mula sa pamamalimos o pag-utang. Tinatanaw rin niya ang isang senaryo pagkatapos ng pandemya, kung saan maaaring muling magkita-kita at kumain ang mga tao sa Maginhawa (isang lugar ng kariwasaan, kaginhawaan at pahinga).​</h2><br />

                            6. 27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</h2><br />

Encircle the letter of the correct answer.Residents of the Central Park area look with alarm at the diabolical plot to change a beautiful spot into a baseball park. If this malicious plan is carried out, the lovely trees in the park will be chopped down. Values of the property within the area will drop sharply as the park fills with the filth and debris of the bulldozers and other equipment. Later the shrieks of the young ruffians who take over the park will destroy the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Obviously, no one cares about the poor resident who has slaved to pay for his home and to keep up with his taxes. In this passage, the author shows bias against…	A. homeowners and taxpayers			C. a baseball field in the park	B. residents of the Central Park area		D. more trees in the parkNew cars are not built as well as they used to be. Owners of new cars in 2002 have more complaints about their automobiles than in past years. In fact, the recalling of new cars by their makers is becoming a routine practice in America. Instead of insisting upon safe, well-designed products, carmakers seem more concerned with throwing together shoddy automobiles and making a profit. Invariably, new cars need parts replaced almost as soon as the warranty expires. Unfortunately, people need transportation, so they continue to buy new automobiles. The author shows bias against…	A. new car owners				C. car repair shops	B. foreign car manufacturers			D. automobile manufacturersEveryone who cooks should own a food processor. This marvelous invention is now being used by over 12 million vegetarians, compared with only half that number a couple of years ago.

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />

Anton’s Indecisiveness Anton who took up the General Academic Strand in Senior High School has a hard time deciding what course to enroll in college. He graduated with honors and has received special citations. He is great in Science and Math but he is also into arts and graphic designing. He was told by his parents to decide for his course since colleges are already closing admission and the school opening is approaching fast. He is spending night analyzing his options. Sometimes he barely sleeps, over-analyzing all considerations. There are also pressures from his friends for him to join them in the university where there are wide variety of Science course he can choose from. He also considers the suggestions of his teachers who see his potential in graphic designing and multimedia arts. Anton really wants to enroll in the most prestigious school to study the course that perfectly fits him. After thorough self-deliberation, he comes down to two schools and four courses. But this does not end his considerations; he still has more factors to visit. His family and friends are starting to worry if he could ever make a final decision. It has finally come one day when everything was in place. Anton finally decides to enroll! He hurries to the school of his choice, but he’s an hour late! The enrolment has just closed for his first choice. To add in more to his regrets, his second chosen program has also reached the maximum number of students and it was closed days ago. Sad and full of regrets, Anton goes home thinking of the lost time overthinking his options. And that is because he can just not make up his mind. Processing Questions: Write your answers on a sheet of paper. 1. Did you experience spending more time to make a decision that greatly affects you or your future just like Anton? Share your experience. 2. If you are in his situation, what would be your next move? 3. What should you do so you won’t face the same problem as that of Anton? ​</a>

City High Enrollment hits 4, 387 online and modular students 
Programs for the new normal, beefed up
 By Aldrin S. Quila
 Tribune Post 
Nov. 2-8, 2020 issue 
Despite the pandemic, the school has formally recorded 2, 180 male students and 2, 207 female students comprising the 7% (302 students) of Online Distance Learning Modality (ODL) and 95% (4, 061 students) of Modular Distance Learning modality (MML). Secondary Principal III, Lina M. Laguras emphasized during an interview that the school is now ready for the new normal despite the situation that San Pablo is in. “Through careful crafting and implementing the Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) which serves as the springboard or map, we were able to successfully operate the school opening this year, Dr. Laguras said. Along with the celebration of Teachers’ day last October 5, San Pablo City International High School (SPCIHS) officially welcomed the close to 4, 500 online and offline students who enrolled this academic year 2020-2022. She also added that since the school offers both online and modular classes, its enrolees increased and some problems might be encountered. “Some of the problems we that are now facing is the over-crowded numbers of transferees since we open our school to a wider span as we follow the Education for All Law, but through the collaborative efforts of the Central and Regional Office of Department of Education (DepEd), Local Government Unit (LGU) and City Government of San Pablo led by City Governor Loreto “Amben” Amante, DepEd-San Pablo City spearheaded by Schools Division Superintendent Daisy Miranda Ed. D, teachers and those who support our school, we are trying our best to render good services and quality education for all,” the principal said. Meanwhile, she reminded everyone to spread Positivity and Hope instead of hates and rants; thus, to continue support the education amidst pandemic. On the other hand, Assistant Regional Director Ruth L. Fuentes visited the school last October 8 and inspected the facilities, enrollment, implementation of LCP, modules distributions as well as the preparedness of the school for the said new normal. Last September, the school conducted its face-to-face Parents’ Orientation and distributed modules to the parents while strictly following the safety protocols.</a>

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

                                            Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

Senior High School that will not only cater to the graduating students of your Junior High School but also to the other students coming from nearby schools that will not have Grade 11 and 12. Because of this, the administration and the Board of Trustees deem it is possible to transfer the basic education unit to a new campus. However, there are financial constraints that the schools need to deal with. As the head of the ad hoc
committee that is tasked to help the school look for its needed financial resources, you are tasked to examine the loans offered by BPI, Banco de Oro and MetroBank. The school tends to borrow P30,000,000.00 and plans to pay this in five years. Your task is to make a comparison and come up with recommendations and the board or

He graduated with honors and has received special citations. He is great in Science and Math but he is also into arts and graphic designing. He was told by his parents to decide for his course since colleges are already closing admission and the school opening is approaching fast. He is spending night analyzing his options. Sometimes he barely sleeps, over-analyzing all considerations. There are also pressures from his friends for him to join them in the university where there are wide variety of Science course he can choose from. He also considers the suggestions of his teachers who see his potential in graphic designing and multimedia arts. Anton really wants to enroll in the most prestigious school to study the course that perfectly fits him. After thorough self-deliberation, he comes down to two schools and four courses. But this does not end his considerations; he still has more factors to visit. His family and friends are starting to worry if he could ever make a final decision. It has finally come one day when everything was in place. Anton finally decides to enroll! He hurries to the school of his choice, but he’s an hour late! The enrolment has just closed for his first choice. To add in more to his regrets, his second chosen program has also reached the maximum number of students and it was closed days ago. Sad and full of regrets, Anton goes home thinking of the lost time overthinking his options. And that is because he can just not make up his mind. Processing Questions: Write your answers on a sheet of paper. 1. Did you experience spending more time to make a decision that greatly affects you or your future just like Anton?

It is an elective method of formal optional training program run by the Bureau of Secondary Education (BSE) of the Department of Education (DepEd) of the Republic of the Philippines. The program gives an open door to primary school graduates, secondary school nonconformists and fruitful examinees of the Philippine Education Placement Test (PEPT) to finish optional instruction in an absolutely distance learning mode. The program gives printed self-learning modules to understudies to use for their illustrations and study hall exercises.</p><p></p><p>Open High School Program is planned for understudies who might somehow not be able to seek after conventional optional training due the inflexible prerequisite of normal class or program plans. It is an option in contrast to going to customary classes yet isn't intended to be helpful to all understudies. Most understudies might in any case learn best by going to the normal proper optional instruction.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

City High Enrollment hits 4, 387 online and modular students 
Programs for the new normal, beefed up
 By Aldrin S. Quila
 Tribune Post 
Nov. 2-8, 2020 issue 
Despite the pandemic, the school has formally recorded 2, 180 male students and 2, 207 female students comprising the 7% (302 students) of Online Distance Learning Modality (ODL) and 95% (4, 061 students) of Modular Distance Learning modality (MML). Secondary Principal III, Lina M. Laguras emphasized during an interview that the school is now ready for the new normal despite the situation that San Pablo is in. “Through careful crafting and implementing the Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) which serves as the springboard or map, we were able to successfully operate the school opening this year, Dr. Laguras said. Along with the celebration of Teachers’ day last October 5, San Pablo City International High School (SPCIHS) officially welcomed the close to 4, 500 online and offline students who enrolled this academic year 2020-2022. She also added that since the school offers both online and modular classes, its enrolees increased and some problems might be encountered. “Some of the problems we that are now facing is the over-crowded numbers of transferees since we open our school to a wider span as we follow the Education for All Law, but through the collaborative efforts of the Central and Regional Office of Department of Education (DepEd), Local Government Unit (LGU) and City Government of San Pablo led by City Governor Loreto “Amben” Amante, DepEd-San Pablo City spearheaded by Schools Division Superintendent Daisy Miranda Ed. D, teachers and those who support our school, we are trying our best to render good services and quality education for all,” the principal said. Meanwhile, she reminded everyone to spread Positivity and Hope instead of hates and rants; thus, to continue support the education amidst pandemic. On the other hand, Assistant Regional Director Ruth L. Fuentes visited the school last October 8 and inspected the facilities, enrollment, implementation of LCP, modules distributions as well as the preparedness of the school for the said new normal. Last September, the school conducted its face-to-face Parents’ Orientation and distributed modules to the parents while strictly following the safety protocols.</h2><br />

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />

                            22. Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

However, there are financial constraints that the schools need to deal with. As the head of the ad hoc
committee that is tasked to help the school look for its needed financial resources, you are tasked to examine the loans offered by BPI, Banco de Oro and MetroBank.

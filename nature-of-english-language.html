                                            What I Have Learned 1. Pre-Spanish Literature is characterized by Legends, Folk Tales, The Epic Age, and Folk Songs. 2. The Propaganda Movement (1872-1896) was spearheaded mostly by the intellectual middle-class like Jose Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce, Jose Ma. Panganiban and Pedro Paterno. 3. In the American Regime, Americans influenced Filipino writers to write using the English language. English as a medium of instruction was introduced in the schools as the intellectual language of education. 4. In the Period of Activism, campus newspapers were written to show their protest. They held pens and wrote on placards in red paint the equivalent of the word MAKIBAKA (To dare!). 5. Period of the New Society poems dealt with patience, regard for native culture, customs, and the beauties of nature and surroundings. 6. The period of the Third Republic was romantic and revolutionary. 7. Post EDSA I noticed in the new Filipino songs, in the newspapers, in the speeches, and even in the television programs.#pahelp Po please ​</a>

                                            Communication Skills of Deaf Students in the Undergraduate Program in Quezon, Philippines. Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</a>

                            6. What I Have Learned 1. Pre-Spanish Literature is characterized by Legends, Folk Tales, The Epic Age, and Folk Songs. 2. The Propaganda Movement (1872-1896) was spearheaded mostly by the intellectual middle-class like Jose Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce, Jose Ma. Panganiban and Pedro Paterno. 3. In the American Regime, Americans influenced Filipino writers to write using the English language. English as a medium of instruction was introduced in the schools as the intellectual language of education. 4. In the Period of Activism, campus newspapers were written to show their protest. They held pens and wrote on placards in red paint the equivalent of the word MAKIBAKA (To dare!). 5. Period of the New Society poems dealt with patience, regard for native culture, customs, and the beauties of nature and surroundings. 6. The period of the Third Republic was romantic and revolutionary. 7. Post EDSA I noticed in the new Filipino songs, in the newspapers, in the speeches, and even in the television programs.#pahelp Po please ​</h2><br />

                            7. Communication Skills of Deaf Students in the Undergraduate Program in Quezon, Philippines. Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />

Provide textual evidence for each point and identify if they are a fact or opinion (1pt. each).Language, Learning, Identity, PrivilegeBy James SorianoAugust 24, 2011, 4:06 amEnglish is the language of learning. I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</h2><br />

Trying not to panic, I showed my problem to my younger sister. My sister carefully evaluated the emergency with the intensity of the chess grandmaster, added some chips, tried something more hairspray and after weighing the whole situation, sho called "a spade a spade" and proclaimed that it was hopeless. I screamed, slammed doors, threw chips around and thought about not showing my Jooo in the wodding. Thankfully, my other sister arrived and transformed the disaster into something more presentable and offered this piece of wisdom. "Your hair is fine, forget about it and do your job as a friend. She's counting on you." I am ashamed to think that I almost let a superficial thing distract me from a more significant event.

They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in the winter-time and they thought that if it were not for the chicken waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer. So they caught it and wrung its neck. But they waren't prepared for the consequences. For what happened was that their mistress, not hearing the chicken crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night characters (major and minor characters give them names, description, traits, and feelings)setting (when and where be descriptive) ((says the book-))problem/conflict (the main dilemma that leads the characters to act the way they did)plot (major sequence of events in order . . . the action)begging       middle      ending​</a>

characterization by answering the questions that follow.Zen Parable: The Monks and the Woman A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. At one point, they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side. The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman. Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey. The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them. Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer, and blurted out “As monks, we are not permitted a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?” The older monk looked at him and replied, “Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her?” SETTING1.

In the story, Louise receives the bad news that her husband, Brently, has died in a train accident. The short story shows the reader how Louise is dealing with these sad news and how she is trying to come to terms with it. However, at the end of the story, there is an unexpected twist: Brently returns home, alive and well. Instead, Louise dies of a heart attack.</p><p></p><p>The setting of the short story is in Louise’s house, presumably in the living room, as Louise is not on her own. She is with her sister, Josephine, who delivers the bad news, and with Richards, “her husband’s friend.” Louise’s house is located on a road, as we learn that “in the street below a peddler was crying his wares.” This suggests that Louise does not live somewhere remote or rural but that she lives in a town. However, it does not appear to be a built-up area nor a huge city, as Louise can see “tops of trees” and she notices that the...</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The news that Mrs. Mallard received was that her husband, Brently Mallard, had died in a train accident.</p><p></p><p>2. The news needed to be broken to her gently because her husband's death would be a great shock to her, and her husband's sister, Josephine, is afraid of the news would cause her to have a heart attack.</p><p></p><p>3.

Throughout the story, specific details give hints about Mrs. Mallard's true feelings about the death of her husband, such as her initial reaction of physical weakness, her realization of freedom, and her feeling of guilt about her newfound freedom.</p><p></p><p>9. The ending of the story is unexpected and tragic. It is suggested that the shock and joy of her newfound freedom, combined with the guilt and conflicting emotions she felt, could have caused her death.</p><br />

At one point, they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side. The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman. Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey. The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them. Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer, and blurted out “As monks, we are not permitted a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?” The older monk looked at him and replied, “Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her?” SETTING1.

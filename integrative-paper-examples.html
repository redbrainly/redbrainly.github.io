 and understanding the article, rewrite it in your own words following the four characteristics 
of a well-written text integrating the two types of claims: explicit and implicit texts. Write 
your answer on a separate sheet of paper.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered 
coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, 
and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-
19 virus, the disease it causes, and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection 
by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face. 9 WHOThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose 
when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).​</a>

These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

</p><p>Video is a fantastic tool to hook your audience. Unlike a long-winded paragraph, it is extremely easy to consume. We’re all guilty of passively scrolling through our social media feeds and only the most compelling content tends to make the grade for our attention. Video allows you to be concise and capture viewers’ interest in the first few seconds. Social media success lies in your ability to condense information down into easily digestible snippets of content that is long enough to maintain viewers’ attention but short enough to leave them wanting more. You should place clear indicators of the videos intention at the beginning before users have the chance to scroll away.</p><p></p><br />

These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free.

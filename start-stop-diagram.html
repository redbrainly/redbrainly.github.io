Preparing and maintaining documentation for your IT infrastructure isn’t a glamorous part of keeping your IT systems running smoothly. It is a critical tool if something goes wrong. Assume you experience a catastrophic network failure. Lack of documentation is a leading cause of costly and time-consuming troubleshooting. When an IT support professional must start from scratch to find IP addresses, physical locations, dependencies and passwords, the time to fix a problem will naturally be much longer and costlier than if documentation were available. Also, infrastructures change. Some network experts find that a new network diagram stops being up to date around the time they’re printing it. To combat this phenomenon, you must document and update the documentation on a regular basis.
Requirements:
An IT Company tasked your group as network experts to create a new Infrastructure with the following parameters and considerations in a particular department of the company:
4 Computer units for the Programmers.
6 Computer units for the Analysts and MIS Staff
Hardware specifications of the devices
Pricing for each device and estimated total costing
Network topologies and layout

                                            Thermodynamics Word Problems:1) A piston-cylinder device contains helium gas initially at 150 kPa, 20°C and 0.5 m³. The helium is now compressed in a polytropic process to 400 kPa and 140 C. Determine the heat loss or gain during this process.2) A rigid tank containing 0.4 m³ of air at 400 kPa and 30°C is connected by a valve to a piston-cylinder device with zero clearance. The mass of the piston is such that a pressure of 200 kPa is required to raise the piston. The valve is now opened slightly, and air is allowed to flow into the cylinder until the pressure in the tank drops to 200 kPa. During the process, heat is exchanged with the surroundings such that the entire air remains at 30°C at all times. Determine the heat transfer for this process.3) A piston-cylinder device initially contains steam at 200 kPa, 200°C and 0.5 m³. At this state, a linear spring (F ∝ x) is touching the piston but exerts no force on it. Heat is now slowly transferred to the steam, causing the pressure and volume to rise to 500 kPa and 0.6 m³, respectively. Show the process on a P-V diagram with respect to saturation lines and determine (a) final temperature, (b) the work done by the steam, (c) the total heat transferred.4) A mass of 5 kg of saturated liquid-vapor mixture of water in a piston-cylinder device at 100 kPa. Initially, 2 kg of the water is in the liquid phase and the rest in the vapor phase. Heat is transferred to the water, and the piston, which is resting on the stops, starts moving when the pressure inside reaches 200 kPa. Heat transfer continues until the volume increases by 20%. Determine (a) the initial and final temperatures, (b) the mass of liquid when the piston starts moving, (c) the work, (d) the heat transfer.5) In large gas turbine power plants, air is preheated by the exhaust gases in a heat exchanger called regenerator before it enters the combustion chamber. Air enters the regenerator at 1 MPa and 550 K at a mass flow rate of 800 kg/min. Heat is transferred to the air at a rate of 3200 kJ/s. Exhaust gases enter the regenerator at 140 kPa and 800 K and leave at 130 kPa and 600 K. Treating the exhaust gases as air, determine (a) the exit temperature of the air and (b) the mass flow rate of exhaust gases.6) Steam enters a turbine steadily at 8 MPa and 550°C with a velocity of 50 m/s and leaves at 20 kPa with a quality of 95%. A heat loss of 30 kJ/kg occurs during the process. The inlet area of the turbine is 150 cm² and the exit area is 1400 cm². Determine (a) the mass flow rate of the steam, (b) the exit velocity, and (c) the power output in kW.7) An insulated vertical piston-cylinder device initially contains 0.2 m³ of air at 200 kPa and 22°C. At this state, a linear spring touches the piston but exerts no force on it. The cylinder is connected by a valve to a line that supplies air at 800 kPa and 22°C. The valve is opened, and air from the high pressure line is allowed to enter the cylinder. The value is turned off when the pressure in the cylinder reaches 600 kPa. If the enclosed volume inside the cylinder doubles during this process, determine (a) the mass of air that entered the cylinder and (b) the final temperature of the air inside the cylinder.8) A 5-L pressure cooker has an operating pressure of 200 kPa. Initially, 20% of the volume is occupied by liquid and the rest by vapor. The cooker is placed on a heating unit that supplies heat to the water inside at a rate of 400 W. Determine how long it will take for the liquid in the pressure cooker to be depleted (i.e., the cooker contains only saturated vapor at the final state).</a>

Who are the characters? Describe each. 3. Make a plot diagram to map the events of the story of the Marikina River. READ The Legend Of Marikina RiverLong time ago in what is now Marikina, there lived a very lovely maiden whose name is Marikit. Marikit likes beings beautiful. She amused herself with wearing pretty dresses and putting on make-up so she would look even more beautiful. Everyone including her female friends all admired her beauty. Not far from where she lives is a small river. She would often pass by the river and everytime she did she would stop for a while and look down on the river at her own reflections on the waters. "How pretty I look!" she would often say to herself. One Sunday morning, her female cousin invited her to go to church to hear mass. She was very excited to go and even asked her cousin to wait her while she got dressed. It didn't take her very long to dress up though it took her quite sometime just putting on the make-up. She couldn't seem to get it done and didn't realize what time it was. Her cousin kept calling out to her to speed up since the mass was about to begin, but still she wouldn't come out. Finally, she entered her room and saw Marikit still fixing her hair in front of the dressing table. "Come on, you're very pretty already!" she spoke alarmingly, then dragged her out of the house. As they had to pass by the river in going to church, Marikit thought she look at herself just once more. As they got to the bank of the river, Marikit suddenly stopped to look at herself. She began to admire herself like always. She even turned to her cousing and asked, "Am I really beautiful?" "You're very, very beautiful already! Let's move on! Otherwise, we'll be late!" yelled her cousin who tried once more to drag her along. But Marikit just pushed her aside and just kept right on amusing herself with arranging the ring of flowers she had around her head. Seeing there was little she could do, her cousin decided to leave and left her there on the riverbank. It had been sometime Marikit hadn't move an inch, still standing on the edge of the riverbank looking down at her image reflected on the waters. She was so engrossed with her beautiful looks that she wasn't even aware that dark clouds have started to moved into the sky overlooking the river. Then without even a warning, rain began to pour heavily on all sides. When she tought of leaving it was already to late. Mud formed quickly that she found it difficult to move around. A wind swept by, so hard it knocked her over into the swelling river. She yelled for help but no one could hear her. By the time the typhoon has passed, she was already carried away by the water and had drowned to her death. Her body remains was found washed away into the other side of the riverbank. Though confirmed dead, she remained beautiful to the onlookers. To remember her by, the towns people had the river named after her. Originally, they had the river named "Marikit ka na" which means "your beautiful already!", the pet phrase by which they used to tease her about with loving affection for she was as sweet as she was pretty. In recent times, the small river had become a big river, while its name has been shortened to "Marikina". Incidentally the entire municipality was also named after her.​</a>

                            9. asic Principles:
Preparing and maintaining documentation for your IT infrastructure isn’t a glamorous part of keeping your IT systems running smoothly. It is a critical tool if something goes wrong. Assume you experience a catastrophic network failure. Lack of documentation is a leading cause of costly and time-consuming troubleshooting. When an IT support professional must start from scratch to find IP addresses, physical locations, dependencies and passwords, the time to fix a problem will naturally be much longer and costlier than if documentation were available. Also, infrastructures change. Some network experts find that a new network diagram stops being up to date around the time they’re printing it. To combat this phenomenon, you must document and update the documentation on a regular basis.
Requirements:
An IT Company tasked your group as network experts to create a new Infrastructure with the following parameters and considerations in a particular department of the company:
4 Computer units for the Programmers.
6 Computer units for the Analysts and MIS Staff
Hardware specifications of the devices
Pricing for each device and estimated total costing
Network topologies and layout

                            10. Thermodynamics Word Problems:1) A piston-cylinder device contains helium gas initially at 150 kPa, 20°C and 0.5 m³. The helium is now compressed in a polytropic process to 400 kPa and 140 C. Determine the heat loss or gain during this process.2) A rigid tank containing 0.4 m³ of air at 400 kPa and 30°C is connected by a valve to a piston-cylinder device with zero clearance. The mass of the piston is such that a pressure of 200 kPa is required to raise the piston. The valve is now opened slightly, and air is allowed to flow into the cylinder until the pressure in the tank drops to 200 kPa. During the process, heat is exchanged with the surroundings such that the entire air remains at 30°C at all times. Determine the heat transfer for this process.3) A piston-cylinder device initially contains steam at 200 kPa, 200°C and 0.5 m³. At this state, a linear spring (F ∝ x) is touching the piston but exerts no force on it. Heat is now slowly transferred to the steam, causing the pressure and volume to rise to 500 kPa and 0.6 m³, respectively. Show the process on a P-V diagram with respect to saturation lines and determine (a) final temperature, (b) the work done by the steam, (c) the total heat transferred.4) A mass of 5 kg of saturated liquid-vapor mixture of water in a piston-cylinder device at 100 kPa. Initially, 2 kg of the water is in the liquid phase and the rest in the vapor phase. Heat is transferred to the water, and the piston, which is resting on the stops, starts moving when the pressure inside reaches 200 kPa. Heat transfer continues until the volume increases by 20%. Determine (a) the initial and final temperatures, (b) the mass of liquid when the piston starts moving, (c) the work, (d) the heat transfer.5) In large gas turbine power plants, air is preheated by the exhaust gases in a heat exchanger called regenerator before it enters the combustion chamber. Air enters the regenerator at 1 MPa and 550 K at a mass flow rate of 800 kg/min. Heat is transferred to the air at a rate of 3200 kJ/s. Exhaust gases enter the regenerator at 140 kPa and 800 K and leave at 130 kPa and 600 K. Treating the exhaust gases as air, determine (a) the exit temperature of the air and (b) the mass flow rate of exhaust gases.6) Steam enters a turbine steadily at 8 MPa and 550°C with a velocity of 50 m/s and leaves at 20 kPa with a quality of 95%. A heat loss of 30 kJ/kg occurs during the process. The inlet area of the turbine is 150 cm² and the exit area is 1400 cm². Determine (a) the mass flow rate of the steam, (b) the exit velocity, and (c) the power output in kW.7) An insulated vertical piston-cylinder device initially contains 0.2 m³ of air at 200 kPa and 22°C. At this state, a linear spring touches the piston but exerts no force on it. The cylinder is connected by a valve to a line that supplies air at 800 kPa and 22°C. The valve is opened, and air from the high pressure line is allowed to enter the cylinder. The value is turned off when the pressure in the cylinder reaches 600 kPa. If the enclosed volume inside the cylinder doubles during this process, determine (a) the mass of air that entered the cylinder and (b) the final temperature of the air inside the cylinder.8) A 5-L pressure cooker has an operating pressure of 200 kPa. Initially, 20% of the volume is occupied by liquid and the rest by vapor. The cooker is placed on a heating unit that supplies heat to the water inside at a rate of 400 W. Determine how long it will take for the liquid in the pressure cooker to be depleted (i.e., the cooker contains only saturated vapor at the final state).</h2><br />

                            11. Learning Task 5: Read the "Legend of Marikina River and Identify the Settings, Characterization and Plot. 1. What is the setting? 2. Who are the characters? Describe each. 3. Make a plot diagram to map the events of the story of the Marikina River. READ The Legend Of Marikina RiverLong time ago in what is now Marikina, there lived a very lovely maiden whose name is Marikit. Marikit likes beings beautiful. She amused herself with wearing pretty dresses and putting on make-up so she would look even more beautiful. Everyone including her female friends all admired her beauty. Not far from where she lives is a small river. She would often pass by the river and everytime she did she would stop for a while and look down on the river at her own reflections on the waters. "How pretty I look!" she would often say to herself. One Sunday morning, her female cousin invited her to go to church to hear mass. She was very excited to go and even asked her cousin to wait her while she got dressed. It didn't take her very long to dress up though it took her quite sometime just putting on the make-up. She couldn't seem to get it done and didn't realize what time it was. Her cousin kept calling out to her to speed up since the mass was about to begin, but still she wouldn't come out. Finally, she entered her room and saw Marikit still fixing her hair in front of the dressing table. "Come on, you're very pretty already!" she spoke alarmingly, then dragged her out of the house. As they had to pass by the river in going to church, Marikit thought she look at herself just once more. As they got to the bank of the river, Marikit suddenly stopped to look at herself. She began to admire herself like always. She even turned to her cousing and asked, "Am I really beautiful?" "You're very, very beautiful already! Let's move on! Otherwise, we'll be late!" yelled her cousin who tried once more to drag her along. But Marikit just pushed her aside and just kept right on amusing herself with arranging the ring of flowers she had around her head. Seeing there was little she could do, her cousin decided to leave and left her there on the riverbank. It had been sometime Marikit hadn't move an inch, still standing on the edge of the riverbank looking down at her image reflected on the waters. She was so engrossed with her beautiful looks that she wasn't even aware that dark clouds have started to moved into the sky overlooking the river. Then without even a warning, rain began to pour heavily on all sides. When she tought of leaving it was already to late. Mud formed quickly that she found it difficult to move around. A wind swept by, so hard it knocked her over into the swelling river. She yelled for help but no one could hear her. By the time the typhoon has passed, she was already carried away by the water and had drowned to her death. Her body remains was found washed away into the other side of the riverbank. Though confirmed dead, she remained beautiful to the onlookers. To remember her by, the towns people had the river named after her. Originally, they had the river named "Marikit ka na" which means "your beautiful already!", the pet phrase by which they used to tease her about with loving affection for she was as sweet as she was pretty. In recent times, the small river had become a big river, while its name has been shortened to "Marikina". Incidentally the entire municipality was also named after her.​</h2><br />

A wind swept by, so hard it knocked her over into the swelling river. She yelled for help but no one could hear her. By the time the typhoon has passed, she was already carried away by the water and had drowned to her death. Her body remains was found washed away into the other side of the riverbank. Though confirmed dead, she remained beautiful to the onlookers. To remember her by, the towns people had the river named after her. Originally, they had the river named "Marikit ka na" which means "your beautiful already!", the pet phrase by which they used to tease her about with loving affection for she was as sweet as she was pretty. In recent times, the small river had become a big river, while its name has been shortened to "Marikina". Incidentally the entire municipality was also named after her.​</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. IT Infrastructure Documentation 
Basic Principles: Preparing and maintaining documentation for your IT infrastructure isn’t a glamorous part of keeping your IT systems running smoothly. It is a critical tool if something goes wrong. Assume you experience a catastrophic network failure. Lack of documentation is a leading cause of costly and time-consuming troubleshooting. When an IT support professional must start from scratch to find IP addresses, physical locations, dependencies, and passwords, the time to fix a problem will naturally be much longer and costlier than if documentation were available. Also, infrastructures change. Some network experts find that a new network diagram stops being up to date around the time they’re printing it. To combat this phenomenon, you must document and update the documentation regularly.
Requirements:
An IT Company tasked your group as network experts to create a new Infrastructure with the following parameters and considerations in a particular department of the company:
4 Computer units for the Programmers.
6 Computer units for the Analysts and MIS Staff
Hardware specifications of the devices
Pricing for each device and estimated total costing
Network topologies and layout
You may use https://app.diagrams.net/ or other similar tools.</h2><br />

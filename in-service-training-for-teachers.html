____1. Ms. Wah left her job as a call center agent and with the money she saved, underwent training in beauty care services (nail care) to obtain a TESDA national certification (NC2). Soon, she set herself up as a traveling makeup artist and manicurist in her hometown, which does not have any beauty salons or such services.
___2. Noticing that there is a large demand for iron grills, Annie, an ABM student without any skill, persuaded her parents to loan her some money to rent a portable welding machine and some basic iron working tools. She, then persuaded her schoolmates in the industrial arts strand who are majoring in shielded metal arc welding to work on a “per job” basis. Since they are not “professionals” they were able to sell their services much cheaper than their competitors.
___3. Mark, a fisherman and former STEM student, lives in an island that has no electrical services and uses kerosene lamps at night. After an accident that resulted in one house being burned down, he was able to remember his chemistry and physics class to make a salt-powered LED lamp, which he sells to his fellow islanders.
___4. John, a social work graduate and a former HUMSS learner from your school, wasn’t able to find a job. Being unemployed, he developed an advocacy against unemployment. By watching videos on the internet, he was able to learn t-shirt printing and bookbinding. He then uses these skills to set up a small shop and hire unemployed “tambays” in the community, making them learn the necessary skills on the job.
____5. Mr. Lim, an ICT teacher, noticed that there is a huge demand for laptops and computers due to a nationally-imposed quarantine. He leaves his job and is now making a lot of money selling laptops and other computer accessories from a Chinese supplier.</a>

                            1. how does a teacher prepares themselves for the pre service training?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pre-service teacher preparation programmes, also called initial teacher training or initial teacher education, vary greatly across countries. The structure, coursework, and field experiences of pre-service programmes are important to consider when designing or reforming teacher training because they all contribute to the level of preparation. High-quality teachers need high-quality training, but many countries may need to consider cost-effectiveness in deciding on the specific combination of pre-service and in-service training experiences needed in order to deploy enough teachers for growing education systems.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong:)</p><p></p><br />

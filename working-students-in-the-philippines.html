During your first week, you've felt homesick so you've decided to take a walk down the street. You've seen a lot of chinese arts, crafts, and even architecture, and have been mesmerized by the china culture and arts. You've talking to your family in the philippines the next day and you need to convey the similarities and difference between China and the Philippines. How would you characterize both countries' arts and crafts?​</a>

came into the picture. Kathy is a Filipino student who grew up and studied in Singapore because
her father was assigned there for work. Now that Kathy’s father is reassigned to the Philippines,
she is now finishing high school here. Ruth’s parents expect her to keep her number 1 spot in the
Top 10 because of the 50% discount the school gives for Top 1 students. It is Ruth’s first time to
meet someone who can really challenge her. What should Ruth do?

Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Developrnent Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer: José Rizal</strong></p><p><strong>Philippine National Hero and Ophthalmologist</strong></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>José Rizal (1861-1896) is one of the most revered figures in Philippine history. He was a multifaceted intellectual and a political activist, best known for his political writings that inspired the Philippine revolution and ultimately led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers. Rizal was also a physician who trained in ophthalmology under 2 prominent European ophthalmologists, Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker.</strong></p><p><strong>Rizal has become a symbol of the Philippine struggle for independence, and he is known there as a national hero. December 30, the date of Rizal's execution in 1896, is celebrated as a national holiday in the Philippines. Jose Rizal College was dedicated to his honor in Manila in 1919. There are commemorative monuments to Rizal in Manila near the site of his execution in Luneta Park, in his hometown, and most Filipino towns, in Heidelberg, and Chicago. His portrait appears on the Filipino 2-peso bill. The region around Manila, including his hometown of Calamba, was designated a province and named Rizal. His novels are required reading for Filipino high school students. Jose Rizal can perhaps be best summarized using his own words from the poem he wrote from his cell the night before his execution. One of the last stanzas of "Ultimo Adios" (Final Farewell) shows his selfless devotion to his country, his loyalty to his family, his deep spirituality despite criticism of the church, and his artistic grace.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            20. Students graduating from Senior High School are not ready for college or for work. Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Developrnent Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Favorable. The statement is accurate, a community is not defined by the individuals that make it up but by the shared values, culture, and history that bind them together. When members of the community come and go, the community continues to function and evolve.</p><p></p><p>2. Favorable. As students, students are considered as community animator or mobilizer since they are part of the society and have the potential to be an agent of change and development. They can be a vehicle to promote awareness and mobilize other members of the community to work together towards a common goal.</p><p></p><p>3. Unfavorable. The statement implies that there is a lack of students who work as community development workers, which may not be the case. The Philippines has a large population and many students who are engaged in community development work. Additionally, it is important to note that the statement is generalizing and may not be applicable to all situations or places.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Please make this as a brainliest answer.</p><br />

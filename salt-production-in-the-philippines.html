Salt beds permit Paraqueños to go back in time when saltmaking was a chief industry and a source of pride. Because of rapid urbanization, most of the agricultural lands have been converted to residential, commercial and industrial estates. Although only few tracts of salt beds remain today, they still continue to provide livelihood, contribute to the economy and attract crowds of locals and tourists at summertime. Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.

Every summer, production of salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on the weather.

Article 2 The Philippine economy also stands not only in the importance of agriculture but with different products also. Filipinos are known to be cosmetically woke in the sense that we are always on the higher bearings of global beauty contests and gave us the presupposition that we don’t need to elaborate it more. Cosmetics has been a large part of our economy contributing $3.8B in 2018 and was projected to have $4.7B by 2026 according to “statista.com.” The compound annual growth rate in the year 2019 -2026 is 4.8%. Having these said, it shows that the pandemic doesn’t discourage us to find a way to improve our physical features. Examples of items used are mud packs that are cosmetic pastes that are applied for the face. It is commonly composed of bleaches, fuller's earth, and astringents. One popular beauty product also are clay masks that's used to help smoothen, cleanse, and brighten hair and skin. Lastly, mechanical exfoliants such as body scrubs, whose purpose is to physically remove dead skin cells from our skin’s outer layer with ingredients such as sugar or salt. Essential oils also are used such as Jasmine Lemon Bergamot, Lavender peppermint. Tea industry on the other hand also plays a big role in our economy because it contributes about $55.20M and is projected to rise up to $109.79M that increases its CAGR of 6.70% from 2020-2025. Different types of teas such as Chamomile tea, black tea, white tea, pu-erh tea , green tea, Ylang-Ylang, and Tea tree. But the tea industry also evolved by the introduction of milk teas by which consumers and producers are trying new flavors. These markets in the economy can be a good boost for our small businessmen and women that want to rise up from the pulling pandemic trend and provide jobs and revitalize our economy ​</a>

Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.

Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.

                            13. How to make it shorter?                          Article 2 The Philippine economy also stands not only in the importance of agriculture but with different products also. Filipinos are known to be cosmetically woke in the sense that we are always on the higher bearings of global beauty contests and gave us the presupposition that we don’t need to elaborate it more. Cosmetics has been a large part of our economy contributing $3.8B in 2018 and was projected to have $4.7B by 2026 according to “statista.com.” The compound annual growth rate in the year 2019 -2026 is 4.8%. Having these said, it shows that the pandemic doesn’t discourage us to find a way to improve our physical features. Examples of items used are mud packs that are cosmetic pastes that are applied for the face. It is commonly composed of bleaches, fuller's earth, and astringents. One popular beauty product also are clay masks that's used to help smoothen, cleanse, and brighten hair and skin. Lastly, mechanical exfoliants such as body scrubs, whose purpose is to physically remove dead skin cells from our skin’s outer layer with ingredients such as sugar or salt. Essential oils also are used such as Jasmine Lemon Bergamot, Lavender peppermint. Tea industry on the other hand also plays a big role in our economy because it contributes about $55.20M and is projected to rise up to $109.79M that increases its CAGR of 6.70% from 2020-2025. Different types of teas such as Chamomile tea, black tea, white tea, pu-erh tea , green tea, Ylang-Ylang, and Tea tree. But the tea industry also evolved by the introduction of milk teas by which consumers and producers are trying new flavors. These markets in the economy can be a good boost for our small businessmen and women that want to rise up from the pulling pandemic trend and provide jobs and revitalize our economy ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Agriculture plays a significant role in the Philippine economy. Involving about 40 percent of Filipino workers, it contributes an average of 20 percent to the Gross Domestic Product. This output comes mainly from agribusiness, which in turn accounts for about 70 percent of the total agricultural output (CIDA-LGSP, 2003).</p><p></p><p>The main agricultural enterprise is crop cultivation. Others are chicken broiler production, including operation of chicken hatcheries (20.4 percent), agricultural services (19.8 percent), and hog farming (18.4 percent) (NSO, 2002).</p><p></p><p>The general trends in the last two decades present a dim picture of the agriculture sector. Significant decrease in productivity, high production costs, and low government support to the sector, among other things, have led to a crisis in Philippine agriculture (CIDA-LGSP, 2003).</p><p></p><p>The neglect of the agriculture sector and the uneven distribution of resources worsened the poverty situation in rural areas. Only the remittances of migrant workers to their families have enabled the latter to survive crippling poverty brought about by stagnant agricultural productivity, stiff competition from cheaper food imports, and periodic droughts and floods that devastated crops and livelihoods.</p><br />

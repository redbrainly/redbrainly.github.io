It can grow up to 28.5 feet (8.7 m). These reptiles are known to be fantastic swimmers, since they require a water source near them. According to Reptile World Facts, Reticulated Pythons are quite aggressive in the wild but captive breeding has changed the reputation of these pythons from that of an aggressive hard to handle snake, to a snake that is easy to care for, and very intelligent, with gorgeous looks. <p></p>3.It is one of the longest underground rivers in the world that outflows directly to the sea, traveling five miles through a subterranean cave system. Inside the Puerto Princesa Underground River, you will see karsts—natural rock formations created by dissolving limestone—loom in every direction.<p></p>4.Manila is now the most densely-populated city in the world, with over 42,000 inhabitants per square kilometer.

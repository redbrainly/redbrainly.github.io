The height and range of a projectile depend on the initial velocity and the (2)(height, angle) at which the projectile is released or launched above the horizontalWhen air resistance is absent, the farthest distance (range) is reached when the angle of launch isequal to (3)(45°, 80°). If a projectile is launched at the same initial velocity but two differentangles, the projectile will land on the same range if the sum of the 2 angles is (4)(80°, 90°)These two angles is said to be complementary angles. On the other hand, when the projectile islaunched at the same initial velocity, the higher maximum height is reached when the angle of launchis (5)(greater, lesser). When the angle of launch is low, the projectile will reach (6)(low, high) maximum height.If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along straightline, then the body is said to be (7)(Uniform Acceleration, Non-uniformAcceleration)The change in an airplane's position for each time interval is increasing and it is movingfaster and faster, this means that the plane is (8)(accelerating, decelerating).Things thrown upward always fall at a constant acceleration which has a magnitude of (9)(9.8 m/s2, 9.8 m/s).The height and the range of a projectile depend on its (10)(initial velocity,final velocity) and angle of launch.Motion of the (11)(stone dropped from hill, stone thrown verticallyupward) shows projectile or follow a curved/parabolic path.​</a>

                            9. _4All projectiles follow a (1)(straight, curved) trajectory or path dueto the pull of gravity. The height and range of a projectile depend on the initial velocity and the (2)(height, angle) at which the projectile is released or launched above the horizontalWhen air resistance is absent, the farthest distance (range) is reached when the angle of launch isequal to (3)(45°, 80°). If a projectile is launched at the same initial velocity but two differentangles, the projectile will land on the same range if the sum of the 2 angles is (4)(80°, 90°)These two angles is said to be complementary angles. On the other hand, when the projectile islaunched at the same initial velocity, the higher maximum height is reached when the angle of launchis (5)(greater, lesser). When the angle of launch is low, the projectile will reach (6)(low, high) maximum height.If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along straightline, then the body is said to be (7)(Uniform Acceleration, Non-uniformAcceleration)The change in an airplane's position for each time interval is increasing and it is movingfaster and faster, this means that the plane is (8)(accelerating, decelerating).Things thrown upward always fall at a constant acceleration which has a magnitude of (9)(9.8 m/s2, 9.8 m/s).The height and the range of a projectile depend on its (10)(initial velocity,final velocity) and angle of launch.Motion of the (11)(stone dropped from hill, stone thrown verticallyupward) shows projectile or follow a curved/parabolic path.​</h2><br />

The motion of the man as it dive into the water is moving along a curved path downwardsdue to a natural force called gravitational force.2. The acceleration due to gravity is always directed upwards.3. An angled-launched projectile exhibits a full parabolic trajectory motion.4. Projectile motion consist of horizontal and vertical motion working independently.5. The horizontal component of projectile motion (with respect to the x-axis) has theacceleration equal to zero since the velocity is not constant.6. Projectile motion is considered as 2-Dimentional motion.7. The vertical component of the projectile motion has constant acceleration.8. The horizontal component of projectile motion has constant velocity since the accelerationwith respect to the x-axis is equal to zero.9.

                            21.  Write TRUE if the statement is correct, if not write FALSE. 1. Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object launched in the air. 2. The horizontal acceleration of a projectile at highest point is zero. 3. The greater the angle of release of an object upward, the greater is the range and peak. 4. The vertical component of a projectile's motion is constant. 5. At any point, the vertical acceleration of a projectile has a magnitude of 9.8 m/s? 6. Acceleration is a vector quantity that is defined as the rate at which the object changes its velocity. 7. At the peak of the projectile motion, the horizontal velocity is 0 m/s. 8. Velocity is defined as a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion. 9. Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle that is projected near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only. 10. Speed is the force by which the planet or other body draws object toward its center.​</h2><br />

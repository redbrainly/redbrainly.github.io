                                            The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view—the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm—and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property—appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead—she did not know why—they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.
Based on the historical context of the Great Purge, which is the best explanation of Orwell’s purpose in writing Animal Farm?
to expose those who failed to prevent massive tragedies and oppression
to explain the process by which most governments begin to collapse
to explain to people the dangers of dictatorships and the loss of personal freedom
to express a need for people to be loyal to their leaders and obey them</a>

                                            I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All around the world, smoking has long been a habit. However, smoking cigarettes used to be quite common, well-known as a hip recreational substance, and widely accepted by society worldwide. Due to the numerous health concerns associated with smoking, smoking is less prevalent and more limited nowadays. People are more educated and aware of the dangers of smoking now than ever before. As a result, smoking's appeal has drastically decreased during the previous ten years. Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is more than just an addiction. You can lose approximately 13.8 minutes of your life for every cigarette you smoke. You can lose about 4.6 hours of your life for every pack of cigarettes you smoke. Smoking is expensive, although many of us may not be aware of this or pay attention to it.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I thinks this is already around 700 words srry..</p><br />

                            5. The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view—the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm—and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property—appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead—she did not know why—they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.

For instance, in writing assignment with required number of words, the desire to cheaply meet the minimum word requirement results to inappropriate expanding of the sentence.

A.	to clarify B.	to inform C.	to illustrate D.	to give different examples 14. You are writing a script because you are about to demonstrate the process in baking cookies.

                        <p>Once You Start, It's Hard to Stop</p><p></p><p>Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains the very addictive chemical nicotine. As with heroin or other addictive drugs, the body and mind quickly get used to the nicotine in cigarettes. Soon, a person needs to have it just to feel normal.</p><p></p><p>People start smoking for different reasons. Some think it looks cool. Others start because their family members or friends smoke. Almost all adult tobacco users started before they were 18 years old. Most never expected to become addicted. That's why it's so much easier to not start smoking at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            17. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

This implies that the persona has strong feelings of nostalgia and longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>3.  The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />

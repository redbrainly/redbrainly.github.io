                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Without any further information or details about the wiring project, it is difficult to determine which component needs to be moved, changed, or removed to make the LED blink every 2 seconds without causing damage to the circuit. However, here are some general tips to consider:</p><p></p><p>Check the wiring connections: Make sure that all wires are connected properly and that there are no loose or disconnected wires.</p><p></p><p>Check the resistor: If there is a resistor in the circuit, make sure that it is the correct value for the LED being used. If the resistor value is too low, it can cause the LED to draw too much current and burn out.</p><p></p><p>Check the power source: Make sure that the power source being used is appropriate for the circuit and that it is providing the correct voltage and current.</p><p></p><p>Check the timing circuit: If the circuit uses a timing component, such as a capacitor or a timer IC, make sure that it is functioning properly and that the correct values are being used.</p><p></p><p>Based on the given options, it is difficult to determine which component needs to be moved, changed, or removed. Therefore, the answer is E. none.</p><p></p><br />

Protein is the other major component of wheat flour.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3.<strong>Powdered Sugar</strong></p><p></p><p>Cornstarch is added at around 3%, to prevent clumping because sugar is very hygroscopic. It's ideal for dusting, icing, frosting and other decorating as it easily dissolves in liquid to create a thick, spreadable substance. It can be used in cakes and cookies to give a more dense texture.</p><p></p><p><strong>Or</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>confectioners' sugar</strong></p><p></p><p>Powdered or confectioners' sugar is granulated sugar that has been finely ground and mixed with a small amount of cornstarch to prevent caking.

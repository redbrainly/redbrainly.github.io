                                            School closures and learning loss during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic can have a long-term negative impact on the current cohort of school children. Global evidence from past health and disaster-related emergencies show that the impact extends well beyond the period of the disaster or pandemic. It is also likely to affect the children’s economic potential and productivity in adulthood, thus undermining the country’s competitiveness. This policy note analyzes key issues related to the current schooling and learning situation and proposes policy options to prepare for in-person schooling when this is possible. Two nationwide surveys in the Philippines provide a snapshot of the conditions of education in the country: the High Frequency Monitoring (HFM) Household Survey carried out in December 2020 and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Low Income Household Panel and Economic (HOPE) Survey targeting poor and near-poor households carried out in October 2020. The key issues emerging from these data and policy recommendations are summarized in this report. Who What Where When Why And how need kopo ngayun Ty po​</a>

                                            can someone pls summarize or give a conclusion about this?Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law. In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.​</a>

                                            With the enactment of the K to 12 programs, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at th secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I would change the wearing of school uniforms due to the fact that some students are not comfortable wearing them and that would lead them to not focusing properly in school. Although we still need to follow the dress code. And most people now a days express how they feel through the way they dress. Feeling comfortable makes us focus more and it makes us be ourselves better. </p><p>2. In my opinion, it is Jose Rizal because even our past heroes said that Jose Rizal's sacrifice was the biggest one of all. He persuaded filipino's to fight harder and dream bigger through his novels, stories, etc. He was very smart and he helped filipino's so much, let's not forget that he loves Philippines so much. </p><p>3. For me, I think no because as I said earlier they might not be comfortable and some students can't afford uniforms. Although it is up to them because I am just stating my opinions and probably they like uniforms better, but wearing what you're comfortable with helps a lot because your mind is gonna get motivated and it will want to learn more. </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps </p><br />

                            19. School closures and learning loss during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic can have a long-term negative impact on the current cohort of school children. Global evidence from past health and disaster-related emergencies show that the impact extends well beyond the period of the disaster or pandemic. It is also likely to affect the children’s economic potential and productivity in adulthood, thus undermining the country’s competitiveness. This policy note analyzes key issues related to the current schooling and learning situation and proposes policy options to prepare for in-person schooling when this is possible. Two nationwide surveys in the Philippines provide a snapshot of the conditions of education in the country: the High Frequency Monitoring (HFM) Household Survey carried out in December 2020 and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Low Income Household Panel and Economic (HOPE) Survey targeting poor and near-poor households carried out in October 2020. The key issues emerging from these data and policy recommendations are summarized in this report. Who What Where When Why And how need kopo ngayun Ty po​</h2><br />

                            28. can someone pls summarize or give a conclusion about this?Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law. In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.​</h2><br />

                            29. With the enactment of the K to 12 programs, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at th secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

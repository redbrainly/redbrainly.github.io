1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

Read the following literary texts and answer the set of questions relating to each piece     Killing  Time in a Warm Place   (An Excerpt by Jose Y Dalisay jr.)  There were about eight of them, my father woke me up as gently as he could, and found myself staring into the barrel of a carbine. I was being arrested, they said, for a violation of the ant subversion law. I thought they were exaggerating: I wrote manifestos and such and I was 18, I was a fea A few days later, we were trucked off to a new detention" site - the pa Rehabilitation Center in Fort Bonifacio... We sat on benches in the evening and watched the Marlboro sign in the Guadalupe skyline. Sometimes, it almost seemed serene. There was a terror roaming about the country, and it would reach us with every new incoming batch and now and then someone would get picked on by the guards and beaten up Most of us would eventually be released under ane amnesty or other. My own deliverance walked straight out of Kafka: one day in August, an officer arrived with a sheet of papers, among which were mine I was taking a shower when I heard my name being called over the PA system: "Dalisay to the guardhouse!" The news, at the guardhouse was always esther very good or very bad. The officer looked at me and said "Dalisay, are you still here? We have nothing on you. Pack your bags and go home I had been a prison for most of 1973-seven months and four days - not bad, by martial law standards Questions: 1) Who is the narrator in the story? 2) What do you think this story talks about? 3) How was the life of the narrator during his stay in the prison? 4) How can you relate this novel of Jose Dalisay to the time and situation he was when he wrote this piece?​</a>

                                            3. Lolong held the record as the world’s largest crocodile ever captured. However, the time it spent in captivity made it more vulnerable to sickness which led to its death. The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) suggested that instead of capturing wild animals, ecotours that promote the preservation of animals in their natural habitat should be organized. PETA said that crocodiles should spend their time submerged in water deep enough for them to swim. They also emphasized that the crocodiles should be free in the wild, not in big pens.A.Crocodiles are dangerous and a threat to human beings.B.All the wild animals should be placed in a big pen in order to survive.C.Lolong is an animal which represents wild life that could destroy the environment.D.Lolong is the largest crocodile captured, removed from its natural habitat but its captivity caused its sickness, vulnerability, and death.4.We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide to live. Oxygen is necessary for people and animals to live. The carbon dioxide that people and animals breathe out is taken in by plants. Truly, oxygen and carbon dioxide are very important gases that make life possible on earth.The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises.A.The oxygen and carbon dioxide are gases that are essential to us, humans.B.Greenhouse effect is caused by too much oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere.C.Oxygen and carbon dioxide are very important gases that make life possible on earth.D.The carbon dioxide that we breathe out is very useful for the plants to produce oxygen for humans and animals, but too much of it in our atmosphere can cause greenhouse effect and causes temperature to rise.5.Inhabiting tropical rainforests, Philippine eagles are well-adopted to life in thick, mountainous forests. Their short, broad wings and a squared-off tail enable them to rise vertically between trees. They can move around with speed and agility through branches and vines. They can skillfully snatch monkeys, birds, and other mammals from trees. They have taloned feet and tear the meat with sharp, hooked beaks.A.The tropical rainforest is a habitat for Philippine Eagle.B.Philippine eagles are well-adopted to life in thick, mountainous forests.C.The Philippine eagle is a smart and skillful bird that kills many other animals.D.Philippine eagle is tropical rainforest animal with the ability to fly vertically in the forest and has sharp beaks and claws that are used to kill its prey​</a>

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />

                            10. 3. Lolong held the record as the world’s largest crocodile ever captured. However, the time it spent in captivity made it more vulnerable to sickness which led to its death. The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) suggested that instead of capturing wild animals, ecotours that promote the preservation of animals in their natural habitat should be organized. PETA said that crocodiles should spend their time submerged in water deep enough for them to swim. They also emphasized that the crocodiles should be free in the wild, not in big pens.A.Crocodiles are dangerous and a threat to human beings.B.All the wild animals should be placed in a big pen in order to survive.C.Lolong is an animal which represents wild life that could destroy the environment.D.Lolong is the largest crocodile captured, removed from its natural habitat but its captivity caused its sickness, vulnerability, and death.4.We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide to live. Oxygen is necessary for people and animals to live. The carbon dioxide that people and animals breathe out is taken in by plants. Truly, oxygen and carbon dioxide are very important gases that make life possible on earth.The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises.A.The oxygen and carbon dioxide are gases that are essential to us, humans.B.Greenhouse effect is caused by too much oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere.C.Oxygen and carbon dioxide are very important gases that make life possible on earth.D.The carbon dioxide that we breathe out is very useful for the plants to produce oxygen for humans and animals, but too much of it in our atmosphere can cause greenhouse effect and causes temperature to rise.5.Inhabiting tropical rainforests, Philippine eagles are well-adopted to life in thick, mountainous forests. Their short, broad wings and a squared-off tail enable them to rise vertically between trees. They can move around with speed and agility through branches and vines. They can skillfully snatch monkeys, birds, and other mammals from trees. They have taloned feet and tear the meat with sharp, hooked beaks.A.The tropical rainforest is a habitat for Philippine Eagle.B.Philippine eagles are well-adopted to life in thick, mountainous forests.C.The Philippine eagle is a smart and skillful bird that kills many other animals.D.Philippine eagle is tropical rainforest animal with the ability to fly vertically in the forest and has sharp beaks and claws that are used to kill its prey​</h2><br />

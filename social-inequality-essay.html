                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>              The implications of this are discrimination of women in sports and in the workplace, as well as the perpetuation of gender inequality by the media. Statistics have shown that women’s sports do not carry nearly as much value or attention as men’s sports do. In fact, “male athletes get $179 million more in athletic scholarships each year than females do” (Collins). Society places a much higher value on male athletes than they do for females.</p><p></p><p>               This in turn leads to “unequal wages and coverage when compared to men’s sports” (Collins). And when women do make to a high level of competition in their given sport, they are more than often objectified and perceived as nothing more than mere sex symbols. For a male athlete to make it to the professional level, he simply needs to have the talent and work ethic for it. For a female athlete to do the same, she must be beautiful. Too many times spectacular female athletes are overlooked because they are not considered “beautiful” enough by the rest of society. </p><p></p><p>              Actions need to be taken to help this problem, such as promoting female athleticism just as much as male athleticism, and giving female sports more coverage and value in the media. Such discrimination carries on over into the workplace. It is a known fact that a wage gap exists between men and women. When comparing the earnings made by both groups, the “median earnings of full-time female workers are still just 77% of the median earnings of their male counterparts” (Shriver). Not only do women make significantly less than men on average, India Simmons.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  <strong>In a society, everyone has the right to lead his/her life accordingly without any discrimination. When this state is achieved where all individuals are considered to be equal irrespective of their caste, gender, colour, profession, and status, we call it equality. Equality can also be defined as the situation where every individual has the same rights and equal opportunity to grow and prosper. Every individual of society dreams for equal rights and access to resources available at their disposal, but there is a lot of discrimination. This discrimination can be due to cultural differences, geographical differences, the colour of the individual, social status and even gender. The most prevalent discrimination is gender inequality. It is not a localised issue and is limited to only certain spheres of life but is prevalent across the globe. Even in progressive societies and top organisations, we can see many examples of gender bias. Gender equality can only be achieved when both male and female individuals are treated similarly. But discrimination is a social menace that creates division. We stop being together and stand together to tackle our problems. This social stigma has been creeping into the underbelly of all of society for many centuries. This has also been witnessed in gender-based cases. Gender inequality is the thing of the past as both men and women are creating history in all segments together.</strong></p><p><strong>In a society, everyone has the right to lead his/her life accordingly without any discrimination.

The proportion of employees on these bodies should be higher in companies with large numbers of employees.</p><p>The proportion of employee representatives on company boards and remuneration committees should be set to increase over time, moving eventually to majority control and beyond. This could be achieved by requiring that a small proportion of shares be transferred each year to employee-controlled trusts.</p><p>Before making either of these a legal requirement, conformity with provisions such as these could be made a condition of gaining public sector contracts or lower business tax rates.</p><p>A major obstacle to developing the democratic sector (cooperatives, social enterprises, mutuals, employee ownership and share ownership business models) is the lack of knowledge of possible models among professional legal and financial advisers. Governments should promote straightforward routes to employee ownership and establish the necessary legislative support. Governments should also provide a training and advice service on how to set up employee-owned and cooperative companies.</p><p>A government should work out a complete package of measures to grow the democratic sector, complete with tax incentives, sources of advice and support, ready-made rules of governance and sources of finance.</p><p>The constitutions of employee-owned and cooperative business should in all cases be designed to prevent employees selling their companies back to external shareholders.</p><br />

                        Answer<p>There has been a lot of discussion about Gender Equality in the Philippines these past years. In my opinion, our ancestors didn't have problems with gender equality until the Europeans started colonizing the Philippines. There were even Filipina tribal leaders and shaman in the pre-colonial period.  </p>Do you think inequality can be addressed by the Philippine government?<p>We no longer don't have to worry about Gender Inequality when it comes to working. However, there are still some indiscriminate verbal attacks against our women. The Philippine government can help end inequality by imposing heavier punishments for violators.</p>Can you suggest ways on how to reduce social disparity and discrimination in the Philippines? <p>For me, Social disparity is a matter of the heart for each individual.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Despite recognition in the Millennium Declaration of the importance of human rights, equality, and non-discrimination for development, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) largely bypassed these key principles. The fundamental human rights guarantees of equality and non-discrimination are legally binding obligations and do not need instrumental justifications. That said there is a growing body of evidence that human rights-based approaches, and these key guarantees in particular, can lead to more sustainable and inclusive development results.</p><p></p><p>Discrimination can both cause poverty and be a hurdle in alleviating poverty. Even in countries where there have been significant gains toward achieving the MDGs, inequalities have grown. The MDGs have supported aggregate progress—often without acknowledging the importance of investing in the most marginalized and excluded, or giving due credit to governments and institutions which do ensure that development benefits these populations. Recognition of this shortcoming in the MDGs has brought an increasing awareness of the importance of working to reverse growing economic inequalities through the post-2015 framework, and a key element of this must be actively working to dismantle discrimination</p><br />

The violent shaking of the ground produces the greatest property losses and personal injuries.2. During earthquake and you are in indoors, just remember these steps: drop, cover, hold on.First, drop under heavy furniture such as a table, desk, bed or any solid furniture. Next, cover your head and torso to prevent being hit by falling objects. Finally, hold onto the object that you are under so that you remain covered.3. The term "landslide" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. Debris flows (commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of common landslide types.4. There are many cost-effective ways of solving the waste disposal problems, including the popular ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ approach. Local communities must be educated on this form of waste management. 5. Typhoons and hurricanes are cyclones that form over warm, tropical oceans, according to the National Hurricane Center. There is only one key difference between hurricanes and typhoons: their location. Storms in the North Atlantic and central and eastern North Pacific are called hurricanes. Storms in the Northwest Pacific north are called typhoons. Typhoons have stronger winds than hurricanes, but that doesn't mean hurricanes are ​</a>

The violent shaking of the ground produces the greatest property losses and personal injuries.2. During earthquake and you are in indoors, just remember these steps: drop, cover, hold on.First, drop under heavy furniture such as a table, desk, bed or any solid furniture. Next, cover your head and torso to prevent being hit by falling objects. Finally, hold onto the object that you are under so that you remain covered.3. The term "landslide" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. Debris flows (commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of common landslide types.4. There are many cost-effective ways of solving the waste disposal problems, including the popular ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ approach. Local communities must be educated on this form of waste management. 5. Typhoons and hurricanes are cyclones that form over warm, tropical oceans, according to the National Hurricane Center. There is only one key difference between hurricanes and typhoons: their location. Storms in the North Atlantic and central and eastern North Pacific are called hurricanes. Storms in the Northwest Pacific north are called typhoons. Typhoons have stronger winds than hurricanes, but that doesn't mean hurricanes are ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines has been one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia Pacific region. Average annual growth increased to 6.4% between 2010-2019 from an average of 4.5% between 2000-2009. With increasing urbanization, a growing middle class, and a large and young population, the Philippines’ economic dynamism is rooted in strong consumer demand supported by a vibrant labor market and robust remittances. Business activities are buoyant with notable performance in the services sector including business process outsourcing, real estate, tourism, and finance and insurance industries. The Philippine economy has also made progress in delivering inclusive growth, evidenced by a decline in poverty rates and its Gini coefficient. Poverty declined from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 while the Gini coefficient declined from 44.9 to 42.7 over the same period.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic and community quarantine measures imposed in the country have severely impacted economic growth and poverty reduction. Growth contracted significantly in 2020, driven by heavy declines in consumption and investment growth, and exacerbated by the slowdown in tourism and remittances. Similarly, the previous trend in real wages, which is expected to have a positive impact on household incomes—particularly those from the lower income groups—has been severely hampered by the impact of the COVID-19, with negative consequences also for poverty reduction in the Philippines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>your welcome at least give me 5 stars and thanks srry for it was long</p><p></p><p>Answer:</p><strong>The Philippines is ranked 15th among 39 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above the regional and world averages.</strong> Economic growth in the Philippines slowed from 2017 through 2019, turned negative in 2020, and rebounded in 2021.<p></p><p><strong>PABRAINLIEST.</strong></p><br />

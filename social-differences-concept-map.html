Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</a>

                            15. 
Activity 2. Read the texts below and write what language discipline being used on
the space provided before each number.
1. The revolution was shaped by the millennial or generation Y. Also
known as digital natives, millennial
those born between 1982 and
1994 and technology is part of their everyday lives: all their activities are mediated
by a screen. The concept of on and off is completely integrated into their lives.
However, they were not bom into it; they migrated to the digital world from the
analogue one in which they were living.
2. The Philippine government supports foreign investments that will
create employment opportunities, increase export volume and value, encourage the
productivity of resources and help set the foundation for economic development in
the country. With a liberalized foreign investment law, the country allows 100%
foreign equity on some areas of investment, excluding some industries and activities
under the Foreign Investment Negative List.
_3. The point P whose coordinates are (9, 11) is mapped onto P' when
reflected in the x-axis and then pis mapped onto P" when reflected in the v-axis.
Find the coordinates of P"
Solution: Here P has the coordinates 9, -11). When pis mapped onto pp by
reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of Pº become (-9, -11).
4. The oblation is a concrete statue by Guillermo E. Tolentino which
serves as the iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines. It depicts a man
facing upward with arms outstretched, symbolizing selfless offering of oneself to
his union,
5. Everyone feels down at times. The breakup of a relationship or a bad
grade can lead to low mood. Sometimes sadness comes on for no apparent reason.
Is there any difference between these shifting moods and what is called depression?
Anyone who has experienced an episode of depression would probably answer yes.
Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms. This
distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening,
with suicide as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to
their potential, doing poorly in school and staying on the social margins. Depression
is frequently ignored or untreated; the condition often prevents people from taking
steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help is available.</h2><br />

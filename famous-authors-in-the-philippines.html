2." It was such a beautiful moment to represent you,
Philippines. I am forever honored to be part of the legacy, of
our history. In my heart I did everything I can I trained
really hard to be physically fit. I would have sleepless nights
trying to read articles to be updated. I made a lot of
sacrifices people can't sometimes see. Early call time and
late night rest. Trying to be sane and motivated. It was a
challenge but it made me so much stronger everyday.
Salamat mgo kababayan! Mahal ko kayo!"

2." It was such a beautiful moment to represent you,
Philippines. I am forever honored to be part of the legacy, of

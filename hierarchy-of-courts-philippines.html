                            6. how are the social hierarchies of the pre-colonial Philippines categorized ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During Pre-Hispanic times Filipinos can be divided according to these classes: The noble class called the Maginoo; the freeman class called the Timawa; the warrior class called the Maharlika; and the indentured class called the Alipin.</p><p></p><p>The Maginoo were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class that the Datu would come from. The Datu is the leader of the community called a barangay. He is the chieftan somewhat synonymous to a Monarch, Rajah, Sultan, or King.</p><p></p><p>It is unknown if the Datu position was hereditary such as following the lineage of the eldest child especially the eldest son of the Datu, or if the Maginoo class (who were likely all related to one another) elected a Datu. The practice may have varied throughout the Philippines. We have to remember that lowland Filipinos arrived on sailboats called balangays. These early groups would settle near the shorelines or river banks, and their new found community would be called a barangay (similar to the word balangay). The size of a barangay can vary, but usually somewhere between 50 to 100 families, or 30 to 100 houses, or 100 to 500 persons. These migrations were likely led by the Maginoo class who wanted to found a new barangay for themselves.</p><p></p><p>The freeman class known as the Timawa probably made up the bulk of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, acquire any job they want, pick their own wives, and acquire an Alipin. They were however expected to pay taxes, and support the Maginoo class. They are the only class to pay taxes, and hence their importance in the community.</p><p></p><p>The Maharlika had all the rights of the Timawa, but they are specifically the warrior class. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the Timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay, and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense. A Maharlika could change their allegiance to another barangay by marrying into it or by simply moving to it. This however required paying a certain amount to his Datu. A feast would be given in his honor when leaving the barangay.</p><p></p><p>President Marcos' first use of the word Maharlika was quite appropriate because he only used it to name a group of soldiers rather than an entire aristocracy or country.</p><p></p><p>The Alipin had the least rights. They are not exactly slaves in the traditional sense, but they were indentured servants. Basically they served their master who belonged to one of the classes above them. But it does not mean that they did all the work in the barangay. The Timawa were probably expected to do most of the work in the barangay, and the Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing house chores and cooking, or aided the Timawa with their duties at work.</p><p></p><p>There are two type of Alipin. Aliping Namamahay was a servant that lived in their own little house on the property of their master, and Aliping Sagigilid was a servant that lived around the house of their master. An Alipin can actually become free, and become a Timawa provided he or she fulfilled the services of their master, this process is known as Tinimawa. The Alipin did not likely make any money for their services, and hence did not pay taxes.</p><p></p><p>The people who bore the greatest stigma in society were the alipins who were indebted to other alipins. A gigilid of an aliping namamahay was called a bulisik, which meant vile and contemptible. Even lower was the bulislis who was a gigilid indebted to another gigilid. The vulgar name meant that these alipins were so vulnerable that it was like their genitals were exposed. In modern terms we might say they "had their pants down", though bulislis really means, "lifted skirt".</p><p></p><p>The only people lower than the bulislis were slaves who were brought from other communities or who were captured in war. They were considered non-persons until they were accepted into the community. Once accepted, they had the same rights as other alipins</p><br />

                            7. why is the philippine court divided into review courts and trial courts?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Exclusive original jurisdiction is determined by the subject matter and the nature or amount, or both, of the claim. The judiciary is independent and co-equal with the legislative and executive branches. Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts are appointed by the President. Courts of equal and coordinate jurisdiction cannot interfere with each other’s orders and cannot review each other's actions and decisions.  There is no jury system in the Philippines. The Judiciary of the Philippines consists of the Supreme Court, which is established in the Constitution, and three levels of lower courts, which are established through law by the Congress of the Philippines. The Supreme Court has expansive powers, able to overrule political and administrative decisions, and with the ability to craft rules and law without precedent. It further determines the rules of procedure for lower courts, and its members sit on electoral tribunals.
</p><p>
</p><p>Below the Supreme Court is the Court of Appeals, which also has national scope with different divisions based in different regions of the country. Decisions from this court can only be appealed to the Supreme Court. Below this level are Regional Trial Courts, which are spread throughout the country among judicial regions. Some of these courts are specialized to deal with certain types of cases. Below these courts are the first level Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts, which are located in cities and municipalities throughout the country.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the Timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay, and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense. A Maharlika could change their allegiance to another barangay by marrying into it or by simply moving to it. This however required paying a certain amount to his Datu. A feast would be given in his honor when leaving the barangay.</p><p></p><p>President Marcos' first use of the word Maharlika was quite appropriate because he only used it to name a group of soldiers rather than an entire aristocracy or country.</p><p></p><p>The Alipin had the least rights. They are not exactly slaves in the traditional sense, but they were indentured servants. Basically they served their master who belonged to one of the classes above them. But it does not mean that they did all the work in the barangay. The Timawa were probably expected to do most of the work in the barangay, and the Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing house chores and cooking, or aided the Timawa with their duties at work.</p><p></p><p>There are two type of Alipin. Aliping Namamahay was a servant that lived in their own little house on the property of their master, and Aliping Sagigilid was a servant that lived around the house of their master. An Alipin can actually become free, and become a Timawa provided he or she fulfilled the services of their master, this process is known as Tinimawa. The Alipin did not likely make any money for their services, and hence did not pay taxes.</p><p></p><p>The people who bore the greatest stigma in society were the alipins who were indebted to other alipins. A gigilid of an aliping namamahay was called a bulisik, which meant vile and contemptible. Even lower was the bulislis who was a gigilid indebted to another gigilid. The vulgar name meant that these alipins were so vulnerable that it was like their genitals were exposed. In modern terms we might say they "had their pants down", though bulislis really means, "lifted skirt".</p><p></p><p>The only people lower than the bulislis were slaves who were brought from other communities or who were captured in war. They were considered non-persons until they were accepted into the community. Once accepted, they had the same rights as other alipins</p><br />

If you invite an Indian or Filipino at 11:30 am, they'll arrive at 12 pm. Many of the times, they'd be unapologetic of their lack of punctuality. This a sharp contrast to many western countries and even eastern countries like Japan who don't tolerate even 1 minute delay.</p><p></p><p>Laziness &amp; Discipline: People of both countries have quite many lazy people who are unwilling to work hard. (No generalizations, but observations.) They always look for shortcuts and easy methods. Also, they lack discipline and their living is pretty disorganized. This is a sharp contrast to people in Japan, Korea, Singapore,etc who work as long as 12 hours per day and overtime is quite common.</p><p></p><p>Marriage &amp; Dating: People of both countries take relationships seriously with the intention of being together forever. Marriages are considered sacred and divorces are rare. It's encouraged to solve their problems together with mutual understanding, cooperation and compromising. It's discouraged to quit or give up a relationship unless it's a serious problem. This is in contrast to countries like USA or Japan or Korea where dating, breakups, divorces have become a common thing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Exclusive original jurisdiction is determined by the subject matter and the nature or amount, or both, of the claim. The judiciary is independent and co-equal with the legislative and executive branches. Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts are appointed by the President. Courts of equal and coordinate jurisdiction cannot interfere with each other’s orders and cannot review each other's actions and decisions.  There is no jury system in the Philippines. The Judiciary of the Philippines consists of the Supreme Court, which is established in the Constitution, and three levels of lower courts, which are established through law by the Congress of the Philippines. The Supreme Court has expansive powers, able to overrule political and administrative decisions, and with the ability to craft rules and law without precedent. It further determines the rules of procedure for lower courts, and its members sit on electoral tribunals.

</p><p>Below the Supreme Court is the Court of Appeals, which also has national scope with different divisions based in different regions of the country.

                                            Earth bears many minerals which play a major role in our daily lives. Lookaround the room and you'll see many objects that are metal. We mine Earth's oredeposits to make iron, copper, aluminum, and other metals. Mineral fuels, such ascoal, give us energy to heat, air condition, light up and electrify our homes, offices,and factories. Minerals are also mined for stone products to make concrete, brickand glass for our buildings, roads, and playgrounds. And a broad assortment ofEarth's minerals goes into paper, paint, plastics, chemicals, filters, films, fertilizers,and many other products. In your journal or notebook, write a poem, song or aparagraph description that summarizes the importance of minerals in our daily lives.Different minerals are important for different purposes. Good luck!​</a>

                                            1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</a>

                                            What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</a>

I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</h2><br />

Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />

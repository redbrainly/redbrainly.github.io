                                            MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte promised to deliver a short State of the Nation Address (SONA), but the 100-minute speech he delivered on Monday, July 25, lost focus with off-tangent comments, analysts said. In his first SONA, Duterte ignored the teleprompter several times to make ad-libbed remarks, coming back later to his prepared script to finish the points he was making. Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña identified 3 main highlights in Duterte's speech: his reiteration of his war against drugs, the push for federalism, and promise of peace. But Duterte's winding speech, La Viña added, made it difficult to follow his main points. "The speech just went on in various directions...[It's] a lost opportunity because speeches like these are a moment to unify the country, make clear the vision of governance," La Viña told RapplerRappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug, meanwhile, said that the speech should've been adjusted to fit Duterte's speaking style. But political psychologist Cristina Montiel said that the ad-lib-filled speech showed that the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City cannot be packaged, and that he knew how to connect with the audience and speak in the language of the people. She also said that Duterte was "very complicated" and hard to figure out. Montiel noted the repeated use of war images that Duterte used in his speech, particularly when talking about his vow to be relentless in the war against drugs.

Duterte and other senior officials have instigated and incited the killings in a campaign that could amount to crimes against humanity.

                        <p> </p><p>A drug is a substance that affects the way the body functions. If a drug is classified as ‘illegal’, this means that it is forbidden by law. Different illegal drugs have different effects on people and these effects are influenced by many factors. This makes them unpredictable and dangerous, especially for young people. </p><p></p><p></p><p> Depressants are drugs that slow down the central nervous system and the messages that go between the brain and the body. These drugs decrease people’s concentration and slow down their ability to respond. The name ‘depressant’ suggests that these drugs can make a person feel depressed, but this is not always the case. The term depressant purely refers to the effect of slowing down the central nervous system. these drugs are included in depressants: alcohol, opioids (e.g., heroin), barbiturates, GHB.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stimulants</strong> (also referred to as psychostimulants) are drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and speed up the messages going between the brain and the body. These drugs typically increase energy, heart rate and appetite. Some examples of psychostimulants include: <strong>methamphetamine (speed, ice, base), cocaine, dexamphetamine, caffeine, nicotine, MDMA/ecstasy</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hallucinogens</strong> are drugs which typically alter how a person perceives the world. These drugs can change the way a person sees, hears, tastes, smells or feels different things, including experiencing things that aren't there at all. Some examples of hallucinogens include: <strong>ketamine, magic mushrooms, LSD.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            28. MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte promised to deliver a short State of the Nation Address (SONA), but the 100-minute speech he delivered on Monday, July 25, lost focus with off-tangent comments, analysts said. In his first SONA, Duterte ignored the teleprompter several times to make ad-libbed remarks, coming back later to his prepared script to finish the points he was making. Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña identified 3 main highlights in Duterte's speech: his reiteration of his war against drugs, the push for federalism, and promise of peace. But Duterte's winding speech, La Viña added, made it difficult to follow his main points. "The speech just went on in various directions...[It's] a lost opportunity because speeches like these are a moment to unify the country, make clear the vision of governance," La Viña told RapplerRappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug, meanwhile, said that the speech should've been adjusted to fit Duterte's speaking style. But political psychologist Cristina Montiel said that the ad-lib-filled speech showed that the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City cannot be packaged, and that he knew how to connect with the audience and speak in the language of the people. She also said that Duterte was "very complicated" and hard to figure out. Montiel noted the repeated use of war images that Duterte used in his speech, particularly when talking about his vow to be relentless in the war against drugs.

                        Dear Students – Warm Greetings to all of you! I welcome everyone to the school seminar hall.<br /><br />Today, we are here to discuss about the fatal consumption of drugs and how it is destroying the lives of our youth. But before the discussion begins, I would like to deliver a short speech on drug abuse and would like to enlighten our students on this sensitive subject matter.<br /><br />Drugs, as we all know, are an illegal matter which some people drink, smoke, inject or eat for the mental as well as physical effects that it leaves. There are several students who consume drugs out of fun or for various other reasons. People who deal in the selling of drugs create a network and mainly target students in order to make them addicted to drugs. Initially, the drugs are sold to the students for free and gradually when they get addicted to it, they start buying and consuming it. In fact, the students also eventually become a part of their network and start dealing in it.<br /><br />It is observed that students start consuming drugs out of stress or unfair expectations of their teachers as well as parents. Lack of emotional support and disorder in their families make them vulnerable and increase their dependency on drugs. They use it in order to calm down their state of mental agitation. Other than this, it is poverty that compels some students to become a part of the selling and dealing network of drugs and derive their pocket money. Therefore, it becomes like a vicious circle of the drug addicted students from which they seem to find no escape unless the society comes for their rescue.<br /><br />Sadly, the students fail to realize that the consumption of drugs has a severe impact on their physical and mental health, such as they start experiencing mental disorder, their intelligence level decreases, experience deadly diseases and untimely death. When one completely succumbs to the temptation of drugs, it gets very difficult for him/her to recover from its impact except in the centers for drug rehabilitation where they gain a new life, but which involves a high cost. In fact, there are many cases too where even rehabilitation centers fail because of the worst condition of the patients.<br /><br />I, therefore, request all the students to refrain themselves completely from the consumption of drugs before it destroys their health, future and takes away their lives. Don’t even try to touch or come close to them. Drugs can even destroy a complete generation. So think wise and act smart. Shape your future which seems bright and full of achievements. The drugs that doctor prescribes to his/her patients must only be taken in order to combat a specific disease otherwise the government must take strict measures to ban its illegal trade in the market and save our youth from destruction.<br /><br />I want to conclude by saying that drug abuse should be an absolute ‘No’ for all and I sincerely hope that our students will never ever try to consume drugs and will completely stay away from its use. Remember that our country needs you as you are its future and harbinger of progress.<br /><br />Thank You!<br /><br />It’s very important to sensitize our youth on the subject of drug abuse. Drugs are destroying the lives of our youth and putting their future in a great darkness. The use of drugs is making their lives vulnerable and prone to destruction. Therefore, it becomes very important to raise awareness about it amongst our youth and prevent them from succumbing to it. You can even prepare a speech on drug abuse and deliver it on various occasions and platforms.<br />

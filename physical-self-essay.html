                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

Write a 200-word essay to answer the question.Answer. The advantages of mountaineering include the fact that it has a beneficial effect on one's mental health. It will help you focus and be more creative. Additionally, it enhances agility and self-awareness. Mountaineering has a plethora of advantages. The most obvious benefits are increased physical and cardiovascular fitness, as well as body fat reduction through aerobic exercise. Several other less obvious or tangible benefits include a significant increase in personal confidence and collaborative skills, which may be applied in either the workplace or personal life. The disadvantages of mountaineering include the fact that climbers encounter a multitude of risks. Hazards are classified into two types: objective and subjective. An objective hazard is one that is related to the environment and may include adverse weather, hazardous terrain, or inadequate equipment. Subjective hazard, on the other hand, refers to a mountaineer's poor judgment, poor planning, lack of skill, or insufficient conditioning. Another threat is falling rocks, the mountaineer's falling, and altitude and weather-related problems.​</a>

                        What is the physical self?Physical self-concept is the individual's perception of themselves in areas of physical ability and appearance. Physical ability includes concepts such as physical strength and endurance, while appearance refers to attractiveness.What is the importance of physical self?The physical self has been shown to be an important contributor to overarching global perceptions of self-worth in multidimensional, hierarchical models of self-esteem (Fox, 1997). The tenets of James and Harter on importance have at least in part been addressed within the physical domain.It is very hard for everyone to feel fully satisfied with every part of their body. Some physical characteristics are hard or even impossible to change. There are some of my physical appearance that has been bothering me for my entire life. I am not satisfy with my height, hair, and jaw. I was obsessed with my physical imperfection because it destroyed my dream, causes low self-esteem and health issue. <br /><br /><br /><br />	My height is about 164cm and both of my parents and brothers are 140cm tall. I am the tallest person in my family but is the shortest male student when I was in high school. I quit growing when I was 13years old. My parents brought me to a growth specialist to increase my height by changing my diets and taking medications. It was an unsuccessful treatment and my height remains the same ever since. Being short certainly had its disadvantage when it comes to playing sport. I am a passionate and a die-hard volleyball fan. When I was in high school, 8th grade, I applied for school volleyball team. Most of my peers wouldn’t believe in me making the team because the average height of the players on the team were between 180 to 190cm.

                            4. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

SELF IMPROVEMENT</p><p>Self improvement is a self-guided improvement, usually represented by the actions you can take to develop your self, and to enhance your physical, mental, spiritual, social and emotional capabilities. “Improvement of one’s condition through one’s own effort” can also be a definition for self improvement. Your subconscious mind plays a major key in self improvement. You change your habits, behavior and attitudes by changing the contents of it.</p><p>There are many aspects in self improvement; one is the physical improvement. We humans always care how we look because our physical appearance is a biological force that affects on how we deal with others. Our perception of our own attractiveness also has an effect on how we feel confident about ourselves. One way to improve your physical appearance is to getting into the habit of drinking more water. You need to be hydrated in order to have a fair, glowing skin, healthier hair and healthier body. Another way is to be always mindful of your hygiene. Do you daily routine of tasks in cleaning your body, one example is to shower once daily to avoid body odor. Getting enough sleep is another way for physical self improvement. Of course, tiredness is not attractive. You have to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep every night. Getting rid of biting you nails will also help in your improvement. Biting your nails puts lots of germs inside your mouth, this ruins your health. Also, always wear deodorants or antiperspirants. Deodorant prevents sweat from smelling and antiperspirants stops sweating altogether. Of course you want to always smell and look fresh, so this is another way for you to look good. Another way for you to look attractive is to feel confident all the time. Don’t be cocky, this really helps. Always be in proper posture to show confidence. When it comes to clothing, always choose those which compliment the shape of your body. If you don’t know how, you can consult a friend that whom you know is good with clothing. You can also ask for tips and advices. Lastly, occasionally put perfume or body sprays, but be sure not to apply too much of it. 1 to 3 sprays will do. Smell of perfumes last longer when applied on the back of the neck or on your wrist. Next aspect of self development is the mental improvement. Mental strength or toughness is not something that you have to be born with as this is something that can be developed as you grow. One way to develop your mental strength is to listen to professionals and experts of this field. There are many available biographies and audio programs that will teach you to overcome obstacle and be successful in life. Another way is to always bear in mind that failure and handicaps are not hindrances in reaching your goals in life. By doing this, you…</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            9. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

It will help you focus and be more creative. Additionally, it enhances agility and self-awareness. Mountaineering has a plethora of advantages. The most obvious benefits are increased physical and cardiovascular fitness, as well as body fat reduction through aerobic exercise. Several other less obvious or tangible benefits include a significant increase in personal confidence and collaborative skills, which may be applied in either the workplace or personal life. The disadvantages of mountaineering include the fact that climbers encounter a multitude of risks. Hazards are classified into two types: objective and subjective. An objective hazard is one that is related to the environment and may include adverse weather, hazardous terrain, or inadequate equipment. Subjective hazard, on the other hand, refers to a mountaineer's poor judgment, poor planning, lack of skill, or insufficient conditioning. Another threat is falling rocks, the mountaineer's falling, and altitude and weather-related problems.​</h2><br />

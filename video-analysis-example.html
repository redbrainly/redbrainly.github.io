                                            ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</a>

Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</h2><br />

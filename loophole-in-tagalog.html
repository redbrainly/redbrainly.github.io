in the sentences. 
Income tax laws should apply to all levels of society equally. Corporations 
and wealthy citizens who often have access to skilled lawyers should not pay 
proportionately less income tax than other members of society. A system that 
allows the wealthy and the corporate to profit from loopholes is inherently unfair.
Several categories of citizens are less able to pay taxes. Those citizens who 
are middle class often pay more than their fair share simply because they do not 
enjoy this easy access to legal counsel. Also, people who work full-time but earn 
very little, people with disabilities, and people with large families should receive 
some sort of tax break. Some argue that the current tax structure is quite fair.

                            25. Directions: Read the selection below. Take note of the action words that were used 
in the sentences. 
Income tax laws should apply to all levels of society equally. Corporations 
and wealthy citizens who often have access to skilled lawyers should not pay 
proportionately less income tax than other members of society. A system that 
allows the wealthy and the corporate to profit from loopholes is inherently unfair.
Several categories of citizens are less able to pay taxes. Those citizens who 
are middle class often pay more than their fair share simply because they do not 
enjoy this easy access to legal counsel. Also, people who work full-time but earn 
very little, people with disabilities, and people with large families should receive 
some sort of tax break. Some argue that the current tax structure is quite fair.
List down at least 5 verbs or action words used in the selection. Then,

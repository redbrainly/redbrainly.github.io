                                            Directions: Read and analyze the different ways on how to organize the review of related literature and studies in your self-learning module 4, pages 23 to 26. Identify which method has been applied in the given statement/s. 1. The literature review focuses on the method used by the graduating SHS students to raise funds for their entrepreneurship proposal. 2. This indicates the method used by the STEM students in their study on the preservation of our nature using the innovation brought by technology. 3. A review organized in this manner would shift between time periods within each section according to the point made. 4. By this approach of organizing related literatures, major arguments or contrasting differences are grouped according to the authors' agreement or disagreement in their approaches and ideas. 5. In this organization, coherence of author's view on specific issues from one author to another is vividly followed. 6. In this approach, related literatures and studies are organized according to the authors' popularity and fame. 7. Considered as the easiest way of writing related literatures and studies, this approach features how the topic is changed according to year or time. 8. An example of this is writing the main topic in a deductive manner: the trend of teenage pregnancy globally down to the author's locality. 9. Another approach in writing coherent and organized review of related literature and studies is by arranging it according to the development of significant theories. 10. In this manner, materials were written earlier should be cited first before those which were written later.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Literature Review </strong>is a scholarly paper, which includes the current knowledge including substantive findings, as well as theoretical and methodological contributions to a particular topic, While <strong>Literature Studies </strong>is a study in which you read selected  text such as novels, short story or a poem and basically write a paper about it.</p><br />

                            2. What the difference between literature and study?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The Difference between Literature and Study</strong></p><p></p><p>Literature and study can be distinguished in the following two example sentences. First, "the sun rises in the East sets in the West". This is a literature. Study would describe "Earth rotates on its axis". First, literature, figurative language, metaphor, and symbolism; there is no "sunrise from the East". That is the perception of people since long ago. The second is descriptive, fact-based language. Another example, the literary language, "man is a creature created by God who was expelled from heaven". </p><p>According to study "humans are the product of a long evolutionary process". So <strong>the language of study and literature is different</strong>. Literature expresses human wonder at the unknown, at the wonders and fears of nature. While study reveals the laws of nature. The equation, both science and literature work using language. Literary language is easy to understand and use by people in general, while the language of study is often only understood in a limited circle of the scientific community.</p><p><strong>Literature</strong> is the result of human creativity that has a very high value. These values ​​are implied or expressed in a very beautiful and useful diction order for many people. However, this does not mean that simple fiction cannot be called literature. Precisely from this view, it becomes a necessity for authors to always hone their writing skills so that they will produce literary works that are getting better day by day towards the pinnacle (literary works that are beautiful and useful for many people). </p><p>Fiction works-poems, short stories, novels- are the result of word processing, imagination, and factual work by the author which, if trained continuously, will further improve the quality of his work. Writing fiction is becoming easier for more and more people to do with the existence of information technology as it is today.</p><p>It is different from <strong>study</strong>. The acquisition of study is carried out through a systematic process and steps in solving human and environmental problems.  In everyday life, study is still less popular in the community. The study seems to belong only to those on campus or laboratory spaces. Even simple problems can be approached with the study. To think and act scientifically one does not have to have an academic degree in study first.</p><p></p><p>Find more about study and literature here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/208273</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                            3. the sun and the moon story</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Tell me the story about how the Sun loved the Moon so much he died every night just to let her breath.” She asked.
</p><p>
</p><p>“once during a time when the earth was simple, the Sun shone brighter than anything. The people were grateful and rejoiced every time the Sun shone. He brought them joy and warmth, he was even the source of their warmth.
</p><p>
</p><p>But he was lonely, all by himself in the vast skies. He would look down at the people dancing in his radiance and wonder if he was simply destined to a life of solitarily. That was the price he paid for being the brightest, he reasoned.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then there was the Moon.
</p><p>
</p><p>As the Sun grew weary and began to disappear she would rise into the sky, flanked by millions of stars. Her radiance was a sad kind of beauty, one that went unnoticed as the people slept.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Stars watched her with woefulness, hoping that one day they could get close enough so she wouldn’t feel so empty. But they couldn’t. The Moon was untouchable, surrounding herself with a blanket of darkness through the cold nights.
</p><p>
</p><p>Until one day when the Sun was sliding out of the heavens, he caught a glimpse of her. She was peeking up, a rare side of her being exposed to the light. And while the Sun could shine, he knew the Moon could glow, and a faithful whisper trumped an arrogant shout any day.
</p><p>
</p><p>So just as the Stars were wandering into the night, the Sun fell in love like a snowball hurdling down a mountain. How he wished to see her more than the fleeting moments he shared with her at both dawn and dusk.
</p><p>
</p><p>But the Moon was untouchable.
</p><p>
</p><p>Uncurable.
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfreeable.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Go,” she whispered to him one of those nights, her voice as sweet and sorrowful as the last light of morning, “Go and let me breathe, for you and I have decided fates. You illuminate the day, and I cast a glow on the night. We will never be. Our connection would go against what all people believe, all they know.” During the summer he would stay a little longer just in case she would change her mind. It was no use.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Don’t you dare abandon your blessing of light for my darkness.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Those were the last words the Moon was strong enough to speak to the Sun, ” I responded.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The first time I read this I remember how many different things it made me feel.  I felt sad for the Sun and for the Moon (which I understand may sound crazy), but I also felt hopeful because they loved each other enough to not allow the other to give up what made them special.  They understood that the world is bigger than their desires and sometimes the best thing we can do for the one we love is also the hardest- letting go.
</p><p></p><p>It’s vital in any relationship to put the other person ahead of yourself. The link “don’t you dare abandon your blessing of light for my darkness” has stayed with me for years.  It’s important to understand the impact you are having on someone’s life.  Is it positive or negative?  Do they bring something to the world that no one else can?  Are you helping them shine or casting darkness?
</p><p>
</p><p>The Sun and Moon poem helped me realize, that sometimes the ones we want the most, aren’t the ones meant for us.  I’ve written before on if love is a who or when thing, but the truth is sometimes it’s neither and that’s okay.  Each of us owe it to those we love to make sure we are helping them share their gifts with the world, even if it comes at the expense of our personal happiness.

</p><p>She was very angry, and picked up a banana tree to strike him, whereupon he threw sand in her face, and to this day you can see the dark marks on the face of the Moon.
</p><p>Then the Sun started to chase her, and they have been going ever since. Sometimes he gets so near that he almost catches her, but she escapes, and by and by she is far ahead again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ctto: malianflorendo on brainly</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>The analysis of the story “Sun and Moon” by Katherine Mansfield
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>The perception of the world depends on the generation. And the veracity of this statement is undeniable after reading the story “Sun and Moon”, issued from pen of the master of short psychological stories Katherine Mansfield.
</strong><strong>Implicitness of the expression is characteristic of Mansfield’s Flash fiction – the implication, the author's intention not to express her opinion and someway even keep away. These features of the story go back to A. P. Chekhov, a student and follower of whom Mansfield is considered to be.
</strong><strong>Military events of 1914-1918 forced the writer to look back on her childhood. After the tragic death of her brother and many friends, the destruction of the faith in the world harmony and difficult overcoming the deep depression she wanted to return to the world of her childhood in order to pay homage to her brother and her past and to find inner support for herself and for kindred souls of her contemporaries.
</strong><strong>At this stage of life gone forever childhood appeared the "true" life without any vices of maturity. The writer treated her recollections about her childhood as "unattainable happiness", though not everything in this early time of life was serene. Views of Mansfield-child and Mansfield-adult about what was going on at parents’ home differed enormously. Early diary entries of the writer are full of critical remarks about her house, relatives, and the moments in which she felt disjointed from the family. In the letters of Mansfield who became wiser and gained life experience there is a search for the causes of not uncommon parents’ alienation from their children, the dramatic experience of loneliness. The main causes are concern of adults about material well-being of a family, depriving parents of the opportunity to be responsive and attentive, mental apathy and fear of being misunderstood in eagerness to spiritual kinship.
</strong><strong>The story under consideration was written in 1918 and I divide it into two levels: it could be considered a classic story written for children. Also it has a symbolic level – some precious things can be damaged or even destroyed by harsh reality.  </strong><strong>The main theme of the story “Sun and Moon” may be defined as a insuperable gap between children and adults. The text is written without any set structure and with a lot of shifts in the narrative.
</strong><strong> The setting here is of great importance. The story happens inside the house of one rich family. It begins with description of making meticulous preparations for an ostentatious party. Adults, especially parents, are so engrossed in preparations that do not pay attention to children, Sun and Moon, who are hanging about the house. Events are depicted from Sun’s point of view. We look at things through the eyes of a child, sharing his perception of the world.
</strong><strong>The title of the story is rather implicit. It focuses the reader’s attention on the names of the main characters. The names of the children represent their role in the story. Sun and Moon reflect parts of the whole which is a typical feature of a modernist writing. Such names are suggestive of the fact that parents gave to them such names because initially the children were the centre of their universe. The Sun and the Moon are unique things. The Earth moves round the Sun, the Moon moves round the Earth. And the children were unique for their parents, but now the situation is completely changed. The parents don’t spend much time with their own children. Now it is the job of servants to look after the children.
</strong><strong>It is significant to note that the story is deeply psychological. The plot is of minor importance than the scene reproducing the conversation, thoughts or feelings of the characters. The story-teller resorts both to telling and showing as methods of characterization in the story. Moon is sensual and tactile. When she saw the house and the nut she wanted to touch it and asked permission to put her finger on the roof. Sun is definitely the protagonist; this is the story of Sun. He is probably older than Moon. When Sun saw the nut he felt quite tired. He is impressionable. The children are portrayed by the author by means of various stylistic devices.  Nurse compares Moon with a sweet little cherub of a picture of a powder-puff. The simile is accompanied by a repetition “Oh, the ducks! Oh, the lambs! Oh, the sweets! Oh, the pets!” when ladies admire the children, and by a hyperbole when the fat man who came to dinner on Sundays compares Sun with a perfect little ton of bricks. The abundance of stylistic devices makes the narration more vivid and colourful and gives it more authenticity.

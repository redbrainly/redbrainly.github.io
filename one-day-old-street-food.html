                                            HELP ME PLEASE I HAVE TO SUBMIT IN 3 HOURSOnce apon time, There was a king called Midas in a his kingdom. He was very rich, and he loved gold and all the things that is fancy. But he loved his daughter more than anything. One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal. "Now the king and his daughter is living happily ever after.1. what is the title of the story?2. what is the settings of the story?3. who are the characters in the story?4. what is the exposition of the story?5. what is the rising action of the story?6. what is the climax of the story?7. what is the falling action of the story?8. what is the resolution of the story.​</a>

                                            Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. Ayan po yung story pls po need ko na po brainliest ko agar sagot pag matino​</a>

When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

Palanyag, the old name for the city of Parañaque, generally means "my beloved", among other definitions, for as far as its residents are concerned, this best describes their affection for their hometown. Another version came from the combination of the terms "palayan" and "palalayag", the former meaning rice fields of which the city once abounded in and the latter pertaining to the sailing and fishing occupation of many of its residents. This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)"

He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</a>

                                            Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            4. Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. Ayan po yung story pls po need ko na po brainliest ko agar sagot pag matino​</h2><br />

He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</h2><br />

                            13. Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

Please read and follow the instruction carefully.____1.) The numbers that come from counting things are whole numbers, which are the numbers we mostly use in everyday life. ____2.) Natural numbers are numbers we use to stand for a part of something or to compare two quantities.____3.) ½, ¼, 2/3, ¾ are the examples of a whole numbers.____4.) Numbers and relationships among them can be represented in realistic statements, which provide a way to model, investigate, and display real-world relationships. ____5.) Special patterns can be represented by a fairly small collection of fundamental geometrical shapes and relationships that have corresponding symbolic representation.____6.) Changing the size of objects while keeping the same shape can have profound effects owing to the geometry of scaling. ____7.) Mutual relationships can also be expressed in symbols and numbers, and vice versa.____8.) One way to estimate the probability of an event is to consider present events. ____9.) Two quantities are negatively correlated if having more of one is associated with having more of the other.____10.) Science can use deductive logic if general principles about phenomena have been hypothesized, but such logic cannot lead to those general principles.​</a>

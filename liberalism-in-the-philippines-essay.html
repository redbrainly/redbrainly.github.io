                            1. essay about liberal party​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons for the liberal landslide victory in the 1906 election was their exploitation of conservative mistakes. Joseph Chamberlains’ idea of Tariff reform split the conservative party in half. His scheme of placing higher tariffs on non-empire goods was strongly opposed because free trade had served Britain so well since 1846. A split conservative party was much weaker and it was tariff reform that was largely to blame for Balfours resignation as he failed to bring unity to his party. When the conservative party introduced Free Education in 1891 they lost the non-conformist vote to the liberals. As non-conformists were a sizeable proportion of conservative support, this was a significant loss. As the liberals were campaigning to shut down the religious schools to be funded by the scheme most non-conformist votes went to them. This was Balfours scheme, and he didn’t see it through sufficiently. It was conservatives in power at the time of the boer war, although this war ended in victory the conservative underestimation of the boers cost them. The war occurred because Britain wanted to extract gold from an area of land in South Africa. They did not expect the boers to fight back so well, this made the military look weak, they resorted to burning down houses and killing many people. The conservatives were highly criticised for their treatment of the boers. Due to a shortage of workers at the end of the boer war, the conservative government allowed 50,000 Chinese workers to be sent into South Africa to work in poor conditions for poor pay. The conservatives were heavily criticised for this exploitation of imported workers as well, it was a political scandal and the liberals spoke out against it meaning again they were gaining votes from conservative’s losses. Balfour having allowed this to happen faced outrage towards him and his party. Another factor contributing to the liberal victory was its leadership and party unity. The liberal parties’ organisation had been greatly improved under Herbert Gladstone. Many local associations were revitalised and seats were targeted for the election. Their leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman was a firm believer in free trade, Irish Home Rule and the improvement of social conditions which appealed to non-conformists and other groups alienated by the conservatives. Campbell-Bannermans strong leadership and unified party differed largely from the split and weak conservative party. Liberal leadership was strong, creating policies the public supported and forming alliances such as the Lib-Lab Pact. The Lib Lab pact was a secretive deal formed between liberal and labour. Liberals and LRC made agreement where the Liberals wouldn't oppose Labour candidates in the next General Election in 30 constituencies in England and Wales where a Labour candidate was likely win a seat. In return, the LRC restricted their candidates in other constituencies and so prevent a split in the anti-Tory vote. Doubtful if actually helped Liberals in election but increased size of Conservative defeat.

                            4. Discuss the key Japanese officers during the invasion and how the Philippines was liberated.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: The Japanese occupation of the Philippines (Filipino: Pananakop ng mga Hapones sa Pilipinas; Japanese: 日本のフィリピン占領; Hepburn: Nihon no Firipin Senryō) occurred between 1942 and 1945, when Imperial Japan occupied the Commonwealth of the Philippines during World War II.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As at Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000 km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until the surrender of Japan. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.[1]
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The landings on the island of Leyte were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of Leyte and Mindoro were cleared of Japanese soldiers. During the campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a suicidal defense of the islands. Cities such as Manila were reduced to rubble. Around 500,000 Filipinos died during the Japanese Occupation Period.[2]</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: tama na yan </strong></p><p></p><br />

                            11. Why are the Philippines, the US, Japan, and South Korea, among others, considered liberal countries? What characteristics are prevalent in these countries? Is liberalism advantageous to a country such as the Philippines? Explain your answer</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since winning the Philippines presidential election by a comfortable margin, Rodrigo Duterte has made good on his promise to unleash lawless vigilantism to tackle the country’s very real problem with drugs. Due process and human rights went out the window. In three months more than 2,000 people have been killed with the blessing of the Malacanang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In Thailand, more than two years on from a “temporary” military coup, the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong was prevented from entering the country, evidently at Beijing’s behest.</p><p></p><p>Debate about Asia’s international politics is dominated by the nascent strategic competition between the US and China. This division is real, as both great powers have different and potentially irreconcilable visions for the region’s strategic order.</p><p></p><p>But there is a second and more complex cleavage that is important not only for the lives of Asia’s people and for that strategic contest: between liberal and illiberal Asia.</p><p></p><p>After decades of breakneck economic growth, east Asian states and societies have never been more prosperous. But the hope that this would prompt a flowering of liberalism has proven illusory. Following the rapid democratisation of several southeast Asian countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the forces of illiberalism have been on the march.</p><p></p><p>Thailand has fallen back to military rule. The Philippines has a proto-authoritarian strongman in power who cares little for liberal niceties. Malaysia is mired in political crisis, with the reformasi hopes from 1998 as far from view as ever. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Abe government has attacked media freedom and curtailed human rights in disconcerting ways.</p><p></p><p>The only positive story in recent years is the as-yet incomplete democratisation in Myanmar.</p><p></p><p>The liberal ideas to which I refer are not a synonym for democracy in the narrow electoral sense, but relate to key principles that underpin society. The most important of these relate to the impartial rule of law, rights to free expression and association that are respected and enforced, limits on state power, and the prevalence of markets in determining the shape of the society’s economy.</p><p></p><p>Countries like Indonesia and Australia are plainly liberal. China, North Korea and Laos are not. But most countries in the region exist somewhere on a continuum between those extremes, with illiberal forces more dominant than they were.</p><p></p><p>East Asia does not have the kind of clear division that defined European experience in the Cold War, in which geopolitical division mapped identically the political divide. Instead, the US has alliances and partnerships with countries that are liberal democracies, illiberal democracies, and authoritarian dictatorships among others.</p><p></p><p>In the contest for strategic influence, the US and its allies may see eye to eye. But real tensions exist among these partners on matters that are fundamental, at least in principle, to the underlying vision the US has for the region.</p><p></p><p>The recent tensions between Barack Obama and Duterte are only the most visible manifestation of this. If the Philippines does break with the US it will be in part because of differing views about the two governments’ approach to human rights and the rule of law.</p><p></p><p>The region has entered a period of open contestation. Most have tended to focus purely on the geopolitical aspects of this, but the contest is in fact much greater and more challenging. These circumstances make the US’ efforts to use liberal ideas like the rule of law and human rights to advance its interests and ambitions in the region much more complex.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea is not just about managing spheres of influence and distributions of force. It requires aligning a disparate community of states and people, with differing cultures and political systems, behind ideas with which they are plainly uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Put bluntly, liberal ideas about Asia’s future are easier for China and others to resist with illiberalism so prevalent in the region.</p><p></p><p>The vision the US and its allies have for the region is at its most compelling when it is grounded not just in the abstractions of the balance of power and the strategic status quo, but when it entails the expansive conception of a genuinely liberal region.</p><p></p><p>An East Asia in which people can flourish, with their freedoms respected and powerful states checked by ideas and institutions, and in which military power works to protect and expand those freedoms, is a future to which we should all aspire. But first, we have to recognise how far we are from that being released</p><p></p><br />

Education has long been establised here on earth. It cannot be denied that the education system contains outdated processes, old materials and old systems. Educators and institutions can capitalize the boom of innovation and technology to improve the education system that is being offered to students. The education system in the Philippines is slowly riding on the boom of innovation and technology. For example, during the 1990's, teachers heavily use overhead projectors, and what we called "Manila papers" to present various topics to the students. Due to innovation and technology, teachers now use laptops, Powerpoint materials, and Youtube videos to discuss various topics to their students.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipino nationalism refers to the awakening and support towards a political identity associated with modern Philippines leading to a wide-ranging campaign for political, social, and economic freedom in the Philippines. This gradually emerged out of various political and armed movements throughout most of the Spanish East Indies—albeit has long been fragmented and inconsistent with contemporary definitions of such nationalism—as a consequence of more than three centuries of Spanish rule. These movements are characterized by the upsurge of anti-colonialist sentiments and ideals which peaked in the late 19th century led mostly by the ilustrado or landed, educated elites, whether peninsulares, insulares, or native (Indio). This served as the backbone of the first nationalist revolution in Asia, the Philippine Revolution of 1896.[1] The modern concept would later be fully actualized upon the inception of a Philippine state with its contemporary borders after being granted independence by the United States by the 1946 Treaty of Manila.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Thank me later</p><br />

                            19. What is the current type of economy of the Philippines? Is it more on trade liberalization or on protectionism? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines has been one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia Pacific region. Average annual growth increased to 6.4% between 2010-2019 from an average of 4.5% between 2000-2009. With increasing urbanization, a growing middle class, and a large and young population, the Philippines’ economic dynamism is rooted in strong consumer demand supported by a vibrant labor market and robust remittances. Business activities are buoyant with notable performance in the services sector including business process outsourcing, real estate, tourism, and finance and insurance industries. The Philippine economy has also made progress in delivering inclusive growth, evidenced by a decline in poverty rates and its Gini coefficient. Poverty declined from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 while the Gini coefficient declined from 44.9 to 42.7 over the same period.</p><p></p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic and community quarantine measures imposed in the country have severely impacted economic growth and poverty reduction. Growth contracted significantly in 2020, driven by heavy declines in consumption and investment growth, and exacerbated by the sharp slowdown in exports, tourism, and remittances. Similarly, the previous trend in real wages, which is expected to have a positive impact on household incomes—particularly those from the lower income groups—has been severely hampered by the impact of the COVID-19, with negative consequences also for poverty reduction in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the economy has started to recover with a 3.7% year-on-year expansion in the first half of 2021, buoyed by public investment and a recovery in the external environment.  With continued recovery and reform efforts, the country is getting back on track on its way from a lower middle-income country with a gross national income per capita of US$3,430 in 2020 to an upper middle-income country (per capita income range of US$4,096–$12,695) in the short term. Economic growth is expected to further rebound assuming a containment of the virus domestically and globally, an acceleration of mass vaccination pace, and with more robust domestic activity bolstered by greater consumer and business confidence and the public investment momentum. The recovery is expected to also have overall positive impact on poverty reduction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>heart</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>follow</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>During World War II, guerrilla groups played an important role in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation. These groups were made up of local residents who organized themselves to resist Japanese rule and support the Allied war effort.</p><p></p><p>The importance of the guerrilla groups in the liberation of the Philippines was due to several key factors:</p><p></p>Intelligence Gathering: Guerrilla groups were able to gather valuable intelligence on Japanese military activities, including troop movements and weapons supplies. This information was crucial to the success of the Allied war effort and helped to guide the military operations of the Philippine resistance.Sabotage and Harassment: Guerrilla groups carried out acts of sabotage and harassment against the Japanese military, disrupting their operations and making it difficult for them to maintain control over the Philippines.Supplying Allies: Guerrilla groups were able to provide supplies and support to the Allied military, including food, ammunition, and other essential materials. This was critical to the success of the Allied war effort and helped to sustain the resistance.Morale Boosting: The guerrilla groups helped to boost the morale of the Philippine people by demonstrating that resistance was possible and that there was hope for the future. This inspired others to join the resistance and provided a source of inspiration for the Philippines people.<p>Overall, the guerrilla groups were an important factor in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese rule. Through their actions, they helped to gather intelligence, disrupt Japanese operations, supply the Allies, and boost the morale of the Philippine people, all of which contributed to the eventual defeat of the Japanese and the liberation of the Philippines.</p><br />

                            28. why was the liberalism in the philippines short lived? was a reactionary governor general sent to the philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><p>In the XIXth century, Spain opened the Philippines to world trade and that stimulated a remarkable progress in commerce, agriculture and industry. Records show that foreign investors were permitted to do business in Manila as early as 1809. This opened the way to material prosperity and the Filipinos began to enjoy a higher standard of living. The improvement of agriculture, the opening of Manila and other ports to foreign commerce, the development of Manila as a commercial center, easier and faster communication with Spain, increased educational opportunities, and the offering of professional courses, and so forth, led to the emergence of another elite among the native population- the ilustrados. It was in this middle class that liberalism was to take root in the Philippines. Up to that time, the only career that enabled a Filipino to achieve some parity with the conquistadores was to be a priest, the increase of educational opportunities and professional courses opened new vistas for the ambitious scions of the rising class of well-to-do families. However, because of the religious values of the people, the priesthood still remained an attractive and relatively fruitful career.</p><p></p><p>The rise of the ilustrados would not caused the inquietude of the friars were it not for the fact that many of them were being influenced by liberal ideas emanating from the mother country. The revolt in Spain, which had deposed Isabella II, succeeded in establishing a Provisional Republic, which for about two years (1868-1870) put liberalism in the saddle. Under the republic, General Carlos Maria de la Torre, a fierce liberal, was appointed the Governor-General of the Philippines. He encouraged free and open discussion of political and social problems. He abolished strict censorship of the press. He encouraged Filipinos to speak out boldly for the political rights. He openly affirmed his support of the Filipinization of the clergy and the secularization of the parishes held by the friars.</p><p></p><p>In November of 1870, the Spanish Cortes elected a new constitutional monarch (an Italian prince, Amadeo, who reigned only three years) and six months later, brought a new Governor to the Philippines, General Rafael de Izquierdo. He was completely opposed to the liberal policies of his predecessor, and with the help of the monarchists and the friars, he revived press censorship, curtailed political discussions, and declared himself unsympathetic to secularization. De la Torre’s tenure of office was short but it was just long enough to wet the Filipinos’ appetite for their political and social rights.

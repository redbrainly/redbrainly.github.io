                                            When you exchange ideas with someone or you send information to others, you do it in two ways. You either use words to say what you want to say or you express yourself through gestures and facial expressions. Since then, people have the inherent need to communicate. Humans are social beings. They live to interact regularly with others. In fact, their endurance is due to their ability to express themselves and connect to one another and the world they live in. When you look back in the history of humankind, you will find that early man could not speak as you do today. Records show that people have used various communication techniques such as the use of symbols, gestures sounds, drawings, and sign languages (Littlejohn, 2002 as cited in Amudavalli, n.d.). Words and languages developed much later in human history. Over the years, communication has progressed tremendously. Language developed side by side with technology. Now in the 21st century, we realize the power of communication in building relationships and the community at large. Hence, we see the importance of communication. Look at the pictures below. Identify the different ways of communicating with others. Brandon Rules​</a>

                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                                            When you exchange ideas with someone or you send information to others, you do it in two ways. You either use words to say what you want to say or you express yourself through gestures and facial expressions. Since then, people have the inherent need to communicate. Humans are social beings. They live to interact regularly with others. In fact, their endurance is due to their ability to express themselves and connect to one another and the world they live in. When you look back in the history of humankind, you will find that early man could not speak as you do today. Records show that people have used various communication techniques such as the use of symbols, gestures, sounds, drawings, and sign languages (Littlejohn, 2002 as cited in Amudavalli, n.d.). Words and languages developed much later in human history. Over the years, communication has progressed tremendously. Language developed side by side with technology. Now in the 21st century, we realize the power of communication in building relationships and the community at large. Hence, we see the importance of communication. Look at the pictures below.

                            4. When you exchange ideas with someone or you send information to others, you do it in two ways. You either use words to say what you want to say or you express yourself through gestures and facial expressions. Since then, people have the inherent need to communicate. Humans are social beings. They live to interact regularly with others. In fact, their endurance is due to their ability to express themselves and connect to one another and the world they live in. When you look back in the history of humankind, you will find that early man could not speak as you do today. Records show that people have used various communication techniques such as the use of symbols, gestures sounds, drawings, and sign languages (Littlejohn, 2002 as cited in Amudavalli, n.d.). Words and languages developed much later in human history. Over the years, communication has progressed tremendously. Language developed side by side with technology. Now in the 21st century, we realize the power of communication in building relationships and the community at large. Hence, we see the importance of communication. Look at the pictures below. Identify the different ways of communicating with others. Brandon Rules​</h2><br />

Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                            16. When you exchange ideas with someone or you send information to others, you do it in two ways. You either use words to say what you want to say or you express yourself through gestures and facial expressions. Since then, people have the inherent need to communicate. Humans are social beings. They live to interact regularly with others. In fact, their endurance is due to their ability to express themselves and connect to one another and the world they live in. When you look back in the history of humankind, you will find that early man could not speak as you do today. Records show that people have used various communication techniques such as the use of symbols, gestures, sounds, drawings, and sign languages (Littlejohn, 2002 as cited in Amudavalli, n.d.). Words and languages developed much later in human history. Over the years, communication has progressed tremendously. Language developed side by side with technology. Now in the 21st century, we realize the power of communication in building relationships and the community at large. Hence, we see the importance of communication. Look at the pictures below.

The process of analyzing and interpretingthe data gathered from a variety of sourcesfor the intention of drawing conclusionsabout the research questions of interest1.

It is involved with the formulation of a setof activities to be performed in order tosatisfactorily answer the research questionsidentified in the exploration phase6. This interpretative research designstresses the importance of exploring aspecific social phenomenon, such as anevent, an interaction, or a relationship,within the context of its culture8.

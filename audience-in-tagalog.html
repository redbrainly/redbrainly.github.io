Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</a>

Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</h2><br />

                        <p>The customs of the Tagalog were written not for local consumption but for <strong>western readers</strong>; it was done on purpose to give them an exoticized view of the Tagalog natives that would appeal to them. This view was obviously influenced by politics and propaganda and operated with the Western gaze. </p><p></p>Further explanation:<p>Customs of the Tagalogs was written during the Spanish colonial period, exactly like previous colonial books, with the explicit purpose of giving readers an exoticized, Western-outsider-focused view of <strong>the Tagalog natives</strong> that would appeal to them.</p><p></p><p><strong>Juan De Plasencia</strong>, a Franciscan missionary who first arrived in the Philippines in 1577, was the author of the Customs of the Tagalog. He based his writing on two key figures: the observer (de Plasencia), who had his own background, subjectivities, and biases, and the subject (Tagalogs), who was viewed as the “Other,” a metonymic amalgam of communal traits, local customs, and traditions.</p><p></p><p>The primary argument focuses on Juan de Plasencia's observation of Tagalog culture prior to the Spanish occupation. If we take a closer look, we can see that the pre-colonial Filipinos were very <strong>civilized</strong>, had a functioning government structure, and had a vibrant culture.</p><p></p><p>When the Spanish king ordered Juan De Plasencia to compile a list of the Philippines' traditions and customs, he wrote and published The Customs of the Tagalog during the country's Spanish colonial era. During this time, the Philippines were governed by Spain. Different barangays were consciously combined into towns under Spanish rule so that Catholic teachers could more successfully convert the tenants to Christianity. Catholic teachers converted the majority of the marsh residents to Christianity when under Spanish rule. They also started churches, healing facilities, schools, and colleges. The Spanish established and maintained a network of military outposts over to guard their towns.</p><p></p><p>The documentary “Tagalog Customs” demonstrated how our predecessors managed without the support of any significant western governments. The way that our predecessors oversaw a group of people known as barangays was unique. They already conduct business with surrounding nations.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Tagalog here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/3204329#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

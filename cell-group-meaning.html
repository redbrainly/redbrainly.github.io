Person with blood group A can receive blood from which blood group?</strong><strong>Answer:</strong>pulmonary veinsaorta arterywhite blood cells prevents blood from flowing backwards and it also helps force the blood towards the heart.If it gets too low internal bleeding will occurit transports oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues...it carries cells and antibodies that fights infectionsArteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the different body parts. Blood emerges from the heart under high pressure. In order to withstand this pressure, arteries have thick and elastic walls. a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the cardiac cycle by trained fingertips.O negative factor is an inherited protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood has the protein, you're Rh positive. If your blood lacks the protein, you're Rh negative.If your blood type is A positive you can give blood to A+ and AB+ And you could also recieve blood from A+ A- O+ O-<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HOPE THIS HELPS YOU❤️I HAD FUN ANSWERING THIS THO-#CARRYONLEARNING.GODBLESS❤️<br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>5. A. Neurotransmitters</strong></p>Neurotransmitters are like chemical words, sending “messages” from one neuron to another.<p><strong>6. C. Dopamine</strong></p>It makes more sense when you think about the nervous excitement or anxiety you feel while falling for someone. As these feelings grow, the hypothalamus triggers release of other hormones, such as dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Dopamine is associated with your body's reward system.<p><strong>7. D. Endorphine</strong></p><p><strong>8. C. Cerebellum</strong></p> It controls balance, movement, and coordination (how your muscles work together).<p><strong>9. D.

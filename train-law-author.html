                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

" Legislative power is given to a bicameral body, the Philippine Congress, which consists of two chambers - the Senate House (upper chamber) and the House of Representatives flower room). The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country. Senate - The Senate shall consist of twenty -four Senators to be elected to large number of qualified Philippine voters, as may be provided by law. The qualifications to become a senator, as stated in the constitution, are: 1. a natural born citizen of the Philippines; 2. at least thirty -five years of age; 3. can read and write 4. a registered voter; at 5. a resident of the Philippines for at least two years prior to election day.It is worth noting that the composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to that of the house of representatives.

                                            The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major health and economic challenges for millions of Filipinos in the last year, but the effects were particularly burdensome to people displaced or affected by internal armed conflicts and situations of violence.
In response to these humanitarian concerns, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediately focused on supporting the COVID-19 response of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in Mindanao; and the Philippine government's efforts to reduce the virus' spread in congested detention facilities and in conflict zones. It provided trainings on infection prevention and control, management of the dead, and mental health, for frontliners. The ICRC also assisted those who were most economically impacted on by the pandemic and conflict, such as displaced people, families of missing persons and persons with disabilities.
When field trips resumed after COVID-related movement restrictions were eased, the ICRC restarted projects to enhance water, sanitation and access to education for conflict-affected communities, as well as livelihood and cash-for-work programs, often in cooperation with PRC. Dialogue on respect for international humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict, continued with national authorities and weapons bearers, including state and non-state forces.

Editorial: Bullying in School Bullying is a serious case; especially when committed inside the school premises. It can threaten students' physical and emotional safety at school and can negatively impact their ability to learn. How far really could schools address bullying? The best way to address bullying is to stop it before it starts. One thing that the school authorities should do is launch an awareness campaign to make the objectives known to the school, parents, and community members. They can also establish a school safety committee or task force to plan, implement and evaluate the school's bullying prevention program. Bullying is a serious case. The national law itself is not enough to prevent and stop a bully from harming his/her classmate, schoolmate or a friend. Schools carry big responsibility in preventing bullying inside their premises, but parents play a bigger role in disciplining their children. Basic training: Respect. Comprehension Questions: 1.

                            5. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

MAIN CONCEPTS Legislative power According to Section 1 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines: “The legislative power shall be entrusted to the Philippine Congress to consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives, except to the extent reserved to the people by the provision of the initiative and referendum. " Legislative power is given to a bicameral body, the Philippine Congress, which consists of two chambers - the Senate House (upper chamber) and the House of Representatives flower room). The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country. Senate - The Senate shall consist of twenty -four Senators to be elected to large number of qualified Philippine voters, as may be provided by law. The qualifications to become a senator, as stated in the constitution, are: 1. a natural born citizen of the Philippines; 2. at least thirty -five years of age; 3. can read and write 4. a registered voter; at 5. a resident of the Philippines for at least two years prior to election day.It is worth noting that the composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to that of the house of representatives.

                            14. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major health and economic challenges for millions of Filipinos in the last year, but the effects were particularly burdensome to people displaced or affected by internal armed conflicts and situations of violence.
In response to these humanitarian concerns, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediately focused on supporting the COVID-19 response of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in Mindanao; and the Philippine government's efforts to reduce the virus' spread in congested detention facilities and in conflict zones. It provided trainings on infection prevention and control, management of the dead, and mental health, for frontliners. The ICRC also assisted those who were most economically impacted on by the pandemic and conflict, such as displaced people, families of missing persons and persons with disabilities.
When field trips resumed after COVID-related movement restrictions were eased, the ICRC restarted projects to enhance water, sanitation and access to education for conflict-affected communities, as well as livelihood and cash-for-work programs, often in cooperation with PRC. Dialogue on respect for international humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict, continued with national authorities and weapons bearers, including state and non-state forces.

Editorial: Bullying in School Bullying is a serious case; especially when committed inside the school premises. It can threaten students' physical and emotional safety at school and can negatively impact their ability to learn. How far really could schools address bullying? The best way to address bullying is to stop it before it starts. One thing that the school authorities should do is launch an awareness campaign to make the objectives known to the school, parents, and community members. They can also establish a school safety committee or task force to plan, implement and evaluate the school's bullying prevention program. Bullying is a serious case. The national law itself is not enough to prevent and stop a bully from harming his/her classmate, schoolmate or a friend. Schools carry big responsibility in preventing bullying inside their premises, but parents play a bigger role in disciplining their children. Basic training: Respect. Comprehension Questions: 1.

                            2. argumentative essay You agree or disagree to legalize a divorce in philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, divorce is currently not allowed due to the strong influence of the Catholic Church, which believes in the sanctity of marriage. However, with the changing times and the increasing number of failed marriages, there is a growing need to legalize divorce in the country. I firmly believe that divorce should be legalized in the Philippines for the following reasons.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, not allowing divorce goes against the basic human right to seek happiness and fulfillment. Couples who are trapped in unhappy and abusive marriages should be given the option to dissolve their union legally, without being forced to stay together for the rest of their lives. Denying them this option is a violation of their basic human rights.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, legalizing divorce would provide protection for women who are often the victims of domestic violence and abuse. Women who are in abusive marriages are often unable to leave because they have no legal options. Divorce would give them a legal means to leave the abusive relationship and protect themselves and their children.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, divorce would help reduce the stigma surrounding failed marriages. In the Philippines, there is still a strong cultural and religious stigma attached to divorce, which makes it difficult for those who have gone through it. Legalizing divorce would help remove this stigma and provide a more supportive environment for those who have experienced it.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, legalizing divorce in the Philippines would provide an option for those trapped in unhappy and abusive marriages, protect women and children from domestic violence, and help reduce the stigma surrounding failed marriages. It is time for the government to recognize the need for divorce and provide a legal framework for it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS ^√^</p><br />

                            3. write an argumentative essay from the topic of:Should we legalize divorce in the philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  <strong>"</strong><strong>Should </strong><strong>We </strong><strong>Legalize </strong><strong>Divorce </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Philippines" </strong></p><p> </p><p>For the longest time, if I'm not mistaken, the party-list group Gabriela has been filing their own version of a divorce bill since they first entered the parliamentary arena. In the 18th Congress, they've already done so—again—as part of their key advocacies.</p><p>This time, they may yet succeed in getting what they've worked really hard to achieve. But maybe not exactly.</p><p>Banish the thought that the divorce bill approved recently by the House committee on population and family relations would pave the way for something like what Las Vegas has in place for a long time now: A no-fuss process that makes it quite easy for couples to disengage, or decouple.</p><p>According to Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, author of one of three divorce bills approved at the committee level in the House of Representatives, the measure has very strict requirements that would not be an easy way out of a rocky marriage.</p><p>The lawmaker explained that their bills have safety measures to ensure that only “exceptional cases” of couples with “irremediably damaged marriage” will benefit from this measure.</p><p>These safety measures include the provision that a prosecutor would be assigned to determine within six months after filing of the divorce petition if the grounds are valid or if there is collusion between parties, and that the court would also apply a judicial dispute resolution mechanism and try to reconcile the parties within this period.</p><p>Divorce is necessary, Lagman pointed out, because the current options under the Family Code—legal separation, annulment of marriage and declaration of nullity—do not give complete reliefs to qualified parties. Legal separation only grants separation “in bed and board” but does not grant severance of marriage bond, while annulment would allow remarriage only on grounds prior to or simultaneous to the solemnization of marriage.</p><p>On the other hand, “divorce will allow grounds that are supervening or during the marriage like marital infidelity, domestic violence, chronic gambling and engagement in illegal drugs and at the same time allow re-marriage,” he explained, adding that it would also offer protection to children who suffer and witness daily torment and stress.</p><p>Over at the Senate, most of the senators are against legalizing divorce and instead prefer to streamline the annulment process “allowed by our faith and belief,” according to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri.</p><p>"What we don’t like about divorce is it seems to be an easy way out." He said shortening the process of Church-decreed annulment would be a “more accepted” option for his colleagues in the Senate.</p><p></p><br />

                            4. 150 words essay about divorce and abortion.Are you in favor that these two become legal in Philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p>NO, Because Divorce has been seen to have a negative effect on the children involved, especially during the transition period as they deal with the separation of their parents. This may manifest in various ways such as diminished social skills, proneness to anger and increased irritability.Divorce also does not safeguard or promote the mental and physical health of children as it is difficult to cope with one’s problems when one’s family, their main support system, is broken apart.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the divorce may influence the child into losing faith in the concept of a family entirely, which leads to another negative effect of this process. If divorce were to be legalized, it would amplify the mentality that marriage can be easily broken, which may result in people putting less effort into making it last and ensuring that they will pick the right partner. The family is thus put into danger and further exposed to the risk of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Abortion should not be legalized in the Philippines for it is a painful surgery. Despite the use of such anesthetics, Almost 97% of women that committed abortions have been reported experiencing extreme pain during the procedure. Compared to other pains, researchers have rated the pain from abortion as more afflictive than a bone fracture, about the same as cancer pain. The use of more powerful general anesthetics can reduce the pain, but it increases the risk of cervical injury. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Divorce, the dissolution of a marriage, has long been a controversial topic and remains so in many societies today. While some people argue that divorce should be illegal and that marriage should be strictly forever, there are many compelling reasons to support the legalization of divorce.</p><p></p><p>One argument in favor of divorce is that it allows individuals to leave unhealthy or abusive relationships. Marriage should be a partnership based on love, mutual respect, and equality. However, in some cases, one partner may abuse or mistreat the other, leading to a toxic and potentially dangerous situation. In these cases, divorce can provide a way out for the victim and allow them to move on with their lives in safety and with dignity.</p><p></p><p>Another argument for divorce is that it allows for personal growth and happiness. People change over time, and it is not uncommon for individuals to grow apart from their partners. In these cases, staying in a marriage can lead to resentment and unhappiness for both parties. Divorce can provide an opportunity for both individuals to pursue their own interests and find happiness in new relationships or alone.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, divorce can benefit children by providing a better living environment. In cases where the parents are constantly fighting or have a toxic relationship, the children may suffer emotionally and psychologically. Allowing the parents to divorce and move on can create a more peaceful and stable home environment for the children.</p><p></p><p>It is also worth considering the economic benefits of divorce. When a couple remains in an unhappy or unhealthy marriage, they may be less productive and motivated, which can have negative consequences on their careers and overall financial well-being. Allowing divorce can enable individuals to move on and rebuild their lives, potentially leading to improved financial stability and success.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some may argue that divorce should be illegal and that marriage should be forever, there are many compelling reasons to legalize divorce. Divorce can provide a way out of unhealthy or abusive relationships, allow for personal growth and happiness, benefit children by providing a better living environment, and have economic benefits. Therefore, it is important to recognize the value of divorce and to support its legalization.</p><br />

                        <p>Divorce is the legal dissolution of a marriage. It is a process that allows couples to end their legal relationship and move on with their lives. While divorce may not be the ideal solution for every marriage, it should be legal and available to couples who need it. There are several compelling reasons to support the legalization of divorce.</p><p></p><p>First, divorce allows for individual freedom. The right to choose one's own path in life is a fundamental human right. When a marriage is no longer fulfilling or supportive, divorce allows individuals to pursue their own happiness and well-being. It also allows people to leave toxic or abusive relationships, which is crucial for their personal safety and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Second, divorce promotes healthy relationships. When a relationship is no longer working, it is better for all parties involved to end it and move on. By ending a relationship that is not fulfilling or supportive, people are able to find more suitable partners and build healthy and positive relationships. This is important for the well-being of all parties involved.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, some argue that divorce can have negative impacts on children. It is true that children may experience emotional distress after a divorce, and it is important to consider their best interests when making decisions about divorce. However, there are ways in which parents can mitigate the negative impact of divorce on children, such as through co-parenting and therapy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while divorce may not be the ideal solution for every marriage, it should be legal and available to couples who need it. Divorce allows for individual freedom, promotes healthy relationships, and can be managed in a way that minimizes the negative impact on children. It is a necessary option for couples who are unable to resolve their differences and move forward in a healthy and positive manner.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The Philippines and Vatican City are the only states left in the world without divorce. While the 
</p><p>Philippines recognize relative divorce, or legal separation as termed under its Family Code, it has 
</p><p>not sanctioned absolute divorce in the country except for Muslims and foreigners. During pre-

</p><p>legal, pragmatic, and rights-based approach. It argues that divorce protects and strengthens the 
</p><p>family; it is legal, constitutional, and in compliance with the international human rights 
</p><p>obligations of the Philippines; it answers the issues on and inadequacies of the existing legal 
</p><p>framework on nullity, annulment, and legal separation; it is one of the solutions to decrease, if

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Legalization of divorce in the Philippines is a highly controversial issue that has been widely debated for years. The Philippines is one of the few countries in the world where divorce is not allowed, and it is the only country where it is illegal for all citizens, regardless of their religion or cultural background.</p><p></p><p>Proponents of divorce argue that it is a basic human right for individuals to have the freedom to dissolve their marriage if they are in an unhappy or abusive relationship. It provides a legal and moral way out of a marriage that is causing emotional distress, physical harm, or financial instability. It also protects the rights of women and children by allowing them to escape from abusive relationships and seek legal protection.</p><p></p><p>Opponents of divorce, on the other hand, argue that it undermines the sanctity of marriage and the family. They believe that divorce can have a negative impact on children, who may suffer emotional and psychological trauma as a result of their parents' separation. Furthermore, they argue that it can have a negative impact on society as a whole, leading to a breakdown of traditional values and increasing rates of crime, poverty, and social unrest.</p><p></p><p>Despite these opposing views, there is growing support for the legalization of divorce in the Philippines. In 2018, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would allow divorce in certain circumstances, such as when the marriage is irreparable or when one of the spouses has committed adultery. However, the bill has yet to be passed by the Senate, which remains divided on the issue.</p><p></p><p>The push for the legalization of divorce is also gaining momentum from the Catholic Church, which has long been an opponent of divorce. In recent years, some Catholic leaders have recognized that divorce can be a necessary solution for people in abusive or dysfunctional marriages.</p><p></p><p>The legalization of divorce in the Philippines would bring the country in line with many other countries that recognize divorce as a legal and moral option for people in troubled marriages. It would also provide legal protections and recourse for people in abusive marriages, particularly women and children.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the legalization of divorce in the Philippines is a complex and contentious issue that raises important questions about the role of marriage in society and the rights of individuals. While there are valid arguments on both sides, ultimately, the decision to legalize divorce should be based on what is best for the people of the Philippines, particularly those who are in troubled or abusive marriages.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Carry on Learning</p><p>Click the crown if you like my Answer thank you.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Couples made a vow to each other and form a bond to live their lives together.

                            24. divorce in the philippines essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce in the Philippines has been an issue for several years. in fact, the Philippines is the only country in the world besides the Vatican that does not allow divorce, mostly due to religion (de Leon, 2014). Little do people know that GABRIELA Women’s Party has already proposed House Bill No. 1799 or the Divorce Bill. If signed, this bill would allow individuals to be free of their unhappy and most of the time abusive marriages and also gives guidelines for settling financial concerns as well as the custody of the children, if any. But even though people should have the right to leave a bad marriage, divorce should not be legalized in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, what exactly is divorce and why do couples do it? Oxford Dictionaries (2015) defines divorce as “the legal dissolution of marriage by a court or other competent body”. In this, many factors can be blamed like a lack of commitment and equality in the relationship, infidelity, marrying too young, and abuse (Utah State University, 2015). But what it all really boils down to is an unhappy marriage and that is what divorce should be able to fix, if ever it would be allowed. If a person is stuck in a sad, or worse, abusive marriage, then he/she should have the right to escape it. Based on the National Demographic and Health Survey conducted by the National Statistics Office, one out of five women aged 15-49 has experienced physical violence and 14.4 percent of married women have experienced physical abuse from their husbands. Statistics have also shown that wife battery ranked highest among cases of violence against women at 72 percent in 2009, affecting more than 6,000 women (Umil, 2011). On the other hand, a sad marriage is just as bad as an abusive one. According to the Philippine’s Solicitor General’s office, there were 9,117 petitions for annulment filed in 2010, 61 percent of which were filed by women. The pros of divorce definitely have good points, but the Philippine society, with its traditional mindset, is not quite ready for it.</p><p></p><p>The biggest factor as to why the Philippines should reject divorce is religion. Roughly 83 percent of Filipinos are Roman Catholics (de Leon, 2014). This means that the church’s opinion matters a lot to the people, and the church firmly says no. Firstly, marriage is one of the Seven Sacraments that all Catholics celebrate and hold dear.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Divorce (also known as dissolution of marriage) is the optional process of terminating a marriage or marital union. Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimonybetween a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state. Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries, divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property,child custody,alimony (spousal support), child visitation / access, parenting time, child support, and division of debt. In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.</p><p></p><br />

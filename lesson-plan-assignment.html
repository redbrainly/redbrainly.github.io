                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M. S. (2010, April 17). 7 Ways to increase teacher technology integration in the classroom.

Think and decide!Instruction: Read this case study entitled Plastics Products and answer thequestions that follows.Miss Jovina Buenaarte was thirty-six years old way back 2003 when she first startedplastic products. She made up her mind to operate this kind of business when herfriend, a plastic maker, complained about the unavailability of plastic products inthe area which are standard quality. Those that are locally made do not conform tothe requirements set by various users.With a 50,000 starting capital, Miss Buenaarte proceeded to produce plasticproducts as bags kitchen utensils. She personally supervised the mixing of thenecessary materials for productions. Because of good quality control, her productssurpassed the requirements of buyers. Her sales increased considerably even if herselling prices are little higher than those of competitors.The firm soon grew into a multi-million pesos operations. The number of heremployees increased to about a hundred with five assigned to administration andthe rest eithers as drivers or laborers. Her market covered the entire province ofLagunaMiss Buenaarte's success happened right before the eyes of her administrative staff,which since then, had the impression that success is not a hard thing to achieve.It was at this time that Miss Buenaarte tried her hand in the appliance business,where she became quite successful. However, she neglected her plastic productbusiness and soon her employees resigned after the other. After leaving the firm, herproduction assistant, Mr. Noel Dela Cruz, made attempts to duplicate the feat of hisformer boss in the plastic products manufacturingMs.Buenaarte was not successful, however, and she is now in deep thoughtconsidering what her next move should be.Processing Questions:Instruction: Write your answers on the space provided.1.

                            13. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

Think and decide!Instruction: Read this case study entitled Plastics Products and answer thequestions that follows.Miss Jovina Buenaarte was thirty-six years old way back 2003 when she first startedplastic products. She made up her mind to operate this kind of business when herfriend, a plastic maker, complained about the unavailability of plastic products inthe area which are standard quality. Those that are locally made do not conform tothe requirements set by various users.With a 50,000 starting capital, Miss Buenaarte proceeded to produce plasticproducts as bags kitchen utensils. She personally supervised the mixing of thenecessary materials for productions. Because of good quality control, her productssurpassed the requirements of buyers. Her sales increased considerably even if herselling prices are little higher than those of competitors.The firm soon grew into a multi-million pesos operations. The number of heremployees increased to about a hundred with five assigned to administration andthe rest eithers as drivers or laborers. Her market covered the entire province ofLagunaMiss Buenaarte's success happened right before the eyes of her administrative staff,which since then, had the impression that success is not a hard thing to achieve.It was at this time that Miss Buenaarte tried her hand in the appliance business,where she became quite successful. However, she neglected her plastic productbusiness and soon her employees resigned after the other. After leaving the firm, herproduction assistant, Mr. Noel Dela Cruz, made attempts to duplicate the feat of hisformer boss in the plastic products manufacturingMs.Buenaarte was not successful, however, and she is now in deep thoughtconsidering what her next move should be.Processing Questions:Instruction: Write your answers on the space provided.1.

Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

Kind : _____________________________________________3. Strength : _____________________________________________4. Weakness : _____________________________________________5. Importance : _____________________________________________Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Working while in school is a common reality for many students today. With the rising costs of tuition and living expenses, many students are forced to take on part-time or even full-time jobs in order to make ends meet. However, working while in school can have both positive and negative effects on a student's academic performance as well as their overall college experience.</p><p> </p><p>On the positive side, working while in school can provide students with valuable work experience and the opportunity to earn money to pay for their education. This can help students become more financially independent and responsible and also prepare them for the workforce after graduation. Additionally, working can also serve as a motivator for students to perform well academically, as they want to maintain their grades in order to keep their job.</p><p> </p><p>However, working long hours can lead to fatigue and stress, which can negatively impact a student's ability to focus and retain information. Furthermore, working can also lead to less time for studying and completing assignments, which can result in lower grades and a greater risk of failing classes.</p><p> </p><p>Additionally, working students may find it difficult to balance the demands of work and school. They may have to sacrifice sleep or leisure time in order to keep up with their studies. This can lead to burnout and negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, working students may also have a harder time participating in extracurricular activities or building relationships with their classmates, which can make the college experience less enjoyable.</p><p> </p><p>In conclusion, working while in school can have both positive and negative effects on a student's academic performance and overall college experience. Students should strive to find a balance between work and school and prioritize their studies in order to achieve their academic goals. It's important for students to manage their time effectively, communicate with their employer about their school schedule, and seek out academic support services when needed. With the right approach and mindset, working students can successfully balance their responsibilities and achieve academic success.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>try to read kung tama bah HAHA</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>My physical and emotional health suffered but my grades did not. Focusing on my studies gave me a visible sign of success. I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver. My personal experience as a student caregiver, combined with my academic path in student affairs, sowed the seeds for this phenomenological study</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps, make me as a brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The students' academic performance depends on a number of socio-economic factors like students' attendance in the class, family income, mother's and father's education, teacher-student ratio, presence of trained teacher in school, sex of the student, and distance of schools.</p><p></p><p>Working college students will tend to have a lower Grade Point Average (GPA) than non-working college students. This could be due to, but not limited by less sleep, more stress, and less study time, it affects the grades, time spent preparing for class, involvement in co-curricular activities, time spent socializing and overall enjoyment of their college experience of working and non-working students at a mid-sized public university.</p><p></p><p>The basic problem a working student face is the scheduling of routine. These students are considered as hard workers. Working hard sometimes lead to the over-commitment and can result in the fear of losing the game. These students are stressed to complete their all tasks in the given time.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The following study contrasts the efficacy of online delivery relative to face-to-
</p><p>face delivery using an enrolment protocol that largely eliminates self-selection 
</p><p>bias. Only a few previous studies even attempt to control for sample selection. 
</p><p>The study utilizes random assignment of the registrants of a Principles of 
</p><p>Macroeconomics class into two alternative venues: online and face-to-face. 
</p><p>The same professor taught both sections with the same course objectives and 
</p><p>exams. Both the change in student scores from the pre-test to the post-test 
</p><p>and the student’s exam average are modelled as a function of the course 
</p><p>environment, the student’s SAT math score (or ACT equivalent), the student’s
</p><p>GPA prior to taking the course, the student’s gender and the student’s overall 
</p><p>credit hours prior to taking the course. The pre- and post-test had both 
</p><p>standardized and instructor-specific questions. Students in the face-to-face 
</p><p>section have statistically significantly higher exam scores and statistically 
</p><p>significantly greater improvement on the post-test instructor questions. There 
</p><p>is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall nor in 
</p><p>the improvement in the post-test standardized questions. These mixed results 
</p><p>suggest that both course objectives and the mechanism used to assess the 
</p><p>relative effectiveness of the two modes of education may play an important 
</p><p>part in determining the relative effectiveness of alternative delivery methods.</p><p></p><p>sana makatulong ang sagot ko</p><p>hope its help you </p><p>thank you for your question</p><p></p><br />

Her scarlet lips slightly parted as though whispering a caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and unquestioning like a baby. The dead girl lay on the murderer’s arm like a child that asleep. When the police come, the body of the dead girl still carrying on the murderer’s arm. The officers of the police had almost to force the murderer to let go the body of the girl he is carrying. A few hours later when I saw the murderer, he was so different from the old him that abode of a tragic love. When I tried to ask him, I become aware of terrific strain under which he suffered. When I tried to draw from him the motive for the pitiful tragedy, he could only rely, his pale boyish face like a mask. He killed the girl, the girl he loved because of his own good since he wants the girl to be with him alone. That’s the irony of fate! The very greatness of his love made him strangle her. Separated as they were wealth, social position, and all that implies. It was only in death that they could be united.

"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? How will I take care of my kids? What about money? I’m afraid of him and scared to leave. But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
Today was a very special day. It was the day of my funeral. Last night he finally killed me. He beat me to death.</a>

                                            What I Can DoRead and reflect:Genesis 22:1-19The Command to Sacrifice Isaac22 After these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you.” 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him. 4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you.” 6 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So, the two of them walked on together. 7 Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So, the two of them walked on together.9 When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill[a] his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” 13 And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14 So Abraham called that place “The Lord will provide”;[b] as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”[15 The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, 16 and said, “By myself I have sworn, says the Lord: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies, 18 and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.” 19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.Answer the following questions on your notebook:1. What command did God/ Adonai give to Abraham? What was Abraham’s action and reaction?2. What happened to Isaac? What was God’s intention in giving such command to Abraham?3.

                                            Naisha and Yuri are siblings. Most of the time they don’t (1) get along well because of their age gap. Naisha is ten years old while Yuri is one year old. 
When their mom is busy (2) killing two birds with one stone to earn a living, Naisha (3) looks after her baby brother. 
(4) Keeping an eye at her brother is not a (5) piece of cake to do. She has to deal with her brother’s tantrums and hyperactivity.

                                            The Story of the Aged Mother A Japanese Folktale (An excerpt) By Matsuo Basho Long ago, in a tiny village in Japan, there lived a young farmer and his old mother. They lived well but simply until the cruel governor declared a wicked law. He said, "I have no desire for old people in my village. They are weak and cannot do work!" The law was to put the people aging 75 years and above to be abandoned in the mountain. The cruel governor also added, "All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives." This low made the young farmer very sad for his mother was very old. Though he loved his mother, he must obey the governor The young farmer carried his mother to the mountain with a heavy heart. On their way to the mountain, the mother dropped small twigs as markers to help her son get back. When the farmer bade farewell, she advised hiin to return home with the aid of the twigs. This made the son make up his mind to take his mother back home. Filled with dread, he hid his mother in his home. Their kitchen, where he keeps their food, became his mother's new place to live, Time passed, and the farmer was beginning to feel safe when the governor had announced a demand to all of his people that he wanted a rope of ash. Nobody in the village could make one, it was impossible. The farmer became anxious with the governor's demand, so he asked his mother if she knew how to make one. His old mother, filled with the wisdom she gained from her years of living, had smiled to show her son that the govemor's demand is not impossible. She said, "Son, make a rope from a twisted straw." Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes. The governor became happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the farmer tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The fariner had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom. 36. What punishment would the governor give to those who might disobey the law? A. The relatives of those who will disobey will be put to death B. All who will disobey will be buried at the topmost part of the mountain. C. Any citizen who will disobey will be buried alive by his/her relatives. D. All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives. 37. How did the young farmer respond to the law of the governor? A. He must obey the governor B. He would defy the governor's law. C. He should hide his mother from the governor's eyes. D. He could not possibly follow the govemur because he dearly loved his mother 38. What did the govemor think about his demand in making a rope of ash? A. Nobody in the village could make a rope of ash. B. Only the governor himself can make the rope of ash. C. Somebody from the village could make a rope of ash D. It is impossible that someone can think of a way in making a rope of ash. 39. What was the young farmer's reaction upon knowing the governor's demand? A He was certainly desperate. B. He thought that he should not inform his mother about the demand C. He told the other villagers that he could make the govemor's demand D. He did not tell the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. 40. What could be the decision of the governor after knowing that it was the young farmer's aged mother who taught him how to make a rope of ash?

                                            I DID UR MOM LOLLOThe title of this specific piece of poetry is “A Small Elegy”. Now, this title does not really give a reader much to go on. The only thing one would know about this poem is that it is a small one and that it may be about a deceased person or someone who new someone who dies. I say this because elegy is derived from the Latin elegia, which means; A poem or song composed especially as a lament for a deceased person.From the beginning, “A Small Elegy” dramatically establishes that the speaker a stand-in for the poet, is by himself talking to himself. He was with other people, but now he is completely alone–his friends gone, his beloved sleeping elsewhere, unconscious, far away. The speaker is the sole operating consciousness mourning in a world where everyone else is asleep. Against the pitch-black darkness he starts saying things to himself, using white words, which I take to mean words that have a kind of unselfconscious purity about them.He daydreams about his mother ,an “autumnal recollection”, and that in turn moves him back toward his childhood home where his mother seems still to preside–diminished now over an outmoded world. She is smaller, more vulnerable, someone to be protected. “Matku,” he says tenderly in Czech, “Mon maminku,” my little mommy, which the translator has rendered as “my diminutive mom. ” He imagines that after all these years she’s still sitting back there, quietly uncomplaining, thinking about his father who died so long ago.It is the next moment in the poem, when the tense radically changes, that I find especially compelling. “And then she is skinning fruit for me,” he says, “I am in the room. Sitting right next to her. ” He doesn’t say “And then she was skinning fruit for me,” but instead finds himself catapulted into the past as a living present. He has been wrenched out of one time into another.The amplitude of his feeling is nearly unbearable and he starts shaking his fist at God, using a child’s language, calling him a ”bully” because now he is aware that God has taken away so much, because so much is lost. And he then proceeds with the ruthlessness of a logical proposition to face what can no longer be evaded. “Because of all those hours I slept soundly, through calm nights,” he declares that is, because of all those nights when he was safe and unconscious.Because of all the loved ones who are deep in dreams” That is, because of all those who are unconscious now, unaware of the peril that surrounds them he realizes that time is running out and announces: “I can’t stand being here by myself. The lamplight’s too strong. ” Here the lamplight becomes the emblem of a consciousness that is too much to bear, an isolation that is killing: “I am sowing grain on the headland. I will not live long. ” The recognition here is that what he is planting is endangered, imperiled, and vulnerable.What he plants he will not be able to protect. The sowing of grain on the headland is his last gesture, his way of putting a message in a bottle when he knows he won’t last much longer. The poem concludes with a terrible recognition. When I read it, my impulse is to wake up everyone around me everyone l love before it is too late. In conclusion this poem is just one stanza that contains twenty-four lines. The poet refers to the speaker as ‘I’ and he also uses the words ‘my’ and ‘myself’ which lead me to the conclusion that this poem was written in the first person.The speaker in this poem recalls his past after his friends have left and his “darling” (wife, girlfriend, child) is asleep. He first begins to think of his mother then gets to his father. The speaker is empty inside because he has suffered so much great loss. He has suffered so much that he curses God and calls him a “bully” and he says to himself that he cant stand being alone for any longer and he also says that he will not live long which may imply that his life may end sooner than it has to=</a>

                                            This is not a Question I just want to help who need to find the plot of train to busan, you can see here too the main characters Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies. Once regrouped, they struggle through the horde to the front car, where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. However, the homeless man steps on a soda can, alerting the zombies to their location, and Seok-woo and Sang-hwa attempt to hold off the zombies, but Sang-hwa is bitten. At Yon-suk's instigation, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to enter the car by force by allowing all the zombies to eat him. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the vestibule. However, Jong-gil – disgusted at the passengers' selfishness and despairing the loss of her sister, who has become a zombie – allows the zombies to enter and kill them all. And because the other passengers had forced Seok-woo's group to isolate, his group remains safe. Yon-suk also escapes by hiding in the bathroom with a train attendant, with the survivors breaking off into groups, with Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, Jin-hee, Yong-guk, and the homeless man in one group, and Yon-suk, and the final train attendant in the otherA blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk pushes Jin-hee, the train captain, and the train attendant to the zombies to save himself and Jin-hee is bitten. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. Meanwhile, a flaming locomotive derails and the survivors are trapped under a train full of zombies. As the zombies drop by breaking the windows, the homeless man sacrifices himself so that Seok-woo has time to save Su-an and Seong-kyeong through a small hole under the derailed train. Realizing that there is a locomotive that still works, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, and Su-an narrowly avoid the zombies, and the three board the working locomotive and encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo manages to throw him off the train, but is bitten in the process. He teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his sobbing daughter, throwing himself off the train before he turns into a zombie. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong stop at a tunnel. They continue following the tracks on foot. Snipers stationed on the other side prepare to shoot at what they believe to be zombies. Upon hearing Su-an sobbing and singing "Aloha ʻOe" for her father, they lower their weapons, realizing the pair are human, as they help get them to safety.​</a>

The next morning , bright and early, the queen dressed up and wore the gold necklace, then went to the king’s room.       “Good morning, my handsome handsome king,” greeted the queen joyously.

                                            The Story of the Aged Mother A Japanese Folktale (An excerpt) By Matsuo Basho Long ago, in a tiny village in Japan, there lived a young farmer and his old mother. They lived well but simply until the cruel governor declared a wicked law. He said, "I have no desire for old people in my village. They are weak and cannot do work!" The law was to put the people aging 75 years and above to be abandoned in the mountain. The cruel governor also added, "All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives." This law made the young farmer very sad for his mother was very old. Though he loved his mother, he must obey the governor. The young farmer carried his mother to the mountain with a heavy heart. On their way to the mountain, the mother dropped small twigs as markers to help her son get back. When the farmer bade farewell, she advised him to return home with the aid of the twigs. This made the son make up his mind to take his mother back home. Filled with dread, he hid his mother in his home. Their kitchen, where he keeps their food, became his mother's new place to live. Time passed, and the farmer was beginning to feel safe when the governor had announced a demand to all of his people that he wanted a rope of ash. Nobody in the village could make one, it was impossible. The farmer became anxious with the governor's demand, so he asked his mother if she knew how to make one. His old mother, filled with the wisdom she gained from her years of living, had smiled to show her son that the governor's demand is not impossible. She said, "Son, make a rope from a twisted straw." Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes. The governor became happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the farmer tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The farmer had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people. He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom.

                                            The Two BrothersEgyptian Folktale1Once, there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother to live with him and treated him like a son. When the lil' bro grew into a young man, he was an excellent worker. He did the plowing and harvested the corn; there was not an equal in the land. Behold the spirit of a god was with him.2Every morning, the younger bro followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields and every evening he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother and at dawn, he took the bread with him which he had baked and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him his bread and drove the cattle into the field.3Because Anpu loved his brother very much, his wife became jealous and wanted to destroy Bata. One day when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said, "Get up and give me some corn so that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay."4At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which she had painted black and blue, and accused Bata of having beaten her. She pretended to be in great pain. She didn't give him water to wash his hands with, she didn't light the fire for him, she pretended that she was very sick. And Anpu became very angry; he sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable.5When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual loaded with herbs, milk, and wood. And as he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang at him and Bata fled praying to Ra, "My good lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good." And Ra heard his cry; he made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles. And Bata said to his elder brother, "Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father?6And has not your wife been as a mother to me? Now, since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia." Anpu answered, "Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her?" Bata answered, "I did no such thing. Have I not told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?" So Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then he sat down, poured ashes on his head, and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of the Acacia. There was no one with him; he slew wild beasts for food and built himself a house under the acacia tree, which is sacred to the gods.7One day as he walked out of his house, he met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, "Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone. And Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess and Bata loved her very much.What lesson did you learn from the story?​</a>

                            1. There is a beautiful and peaceful girl in her death. Her scarlet lips slightly parted as though whispering a caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and unquestioning like a baby. The dead girl lay on the murderer’s arm like a child that asleep. When the police come, the body of the dead girl still carrying on the murderer’s arm. The officers of the police had almost to force the murderer to let go the body of the girl he is carrying. A few hours later when I saw the murderer, he was so different from the old him that abode of a tragic love. When I tried to ask him, I become aware of terrific strain under which he suffered. When I tried to draw from him the motive for the pitiful tragedy, he could only rely, his pale boyish face like a mask. He killed the girl, the girl he loved because of his own good since he wants the girl to be with him alone. That’s the irony of fate! The very greatness of his love made him strangle her. Separated as they were wealth, social position, and all that implies. It was only in death that they could be united.

"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? How will I take care of my kids? What about money? I’m afraid of him and scared to leave. But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
Today was a very special day. It was the day of my funeral. Last night he finally killed me. He beat me to death.</h2><br />

                            3. What I Can DoRead and reflect:Genesis 22:1-19The Command to Sacrifice Isaac22 After these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you.” 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him. 4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you.” 6 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So, the two of them walked on together. 7 Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So, the two of them walked on together.9 When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill[a] his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” 13 And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14 So Abraham called that place “The Lord will provide”;[b] as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”[15 The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, 16 and said, “By myself I have sworn, says the Lord: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies, 18 and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.” 19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.Answer the following questions on your notebook:1. What command did God/ Adonai give to Abraham? What was Abraham’s action and reaction?2. What happened to Isaac? What was God’s intention in giving such command to Abraham?3. What is the essence of these passages in the Jewish religion?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The command  God/ Adonai give to Abraham was  the Command to Sacrifice Isaac.</p><p> Abraham’s action and reaction was that he didn't said no to God's command rather he obey him and do what God exactly wanted him to do.</p><p></p><p>2. Nothing happened to Isaac as what Genesis 22:9,10 said;</p><p>When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an </p><p>altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the </p><p>altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife </p><p>to kill his son but God in Genesis 22: 12a He said, “Do not lay your hand on </p><p>the boy or do anything to him."</p><p> God’s intention in giving such command </p><p>to Abraham was to test Abraham's faith for what Genesis 22:12b said "for now I know that you fear God, since you have not </p><p></p><p>withheld your son, your only son, from me.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. The essence of these passages in the Jewish religion was that to live with God, because Abraham is the founding father of the Covenant, there's a special relationship between the Jewish people and God which lead to the belief that the Jews are the Chosen People of God.</p><br />

                            7. The Story of the Aged Mother A Japanese Folktale (An excerpt) By Matsuo Basho Long ago, in a tiny village in Japan, there lived a young farmer and his old mother. They lived well but simply until the cruel governor declared a wicked law. He said, "I have no desire for old people in my village. They are weak and cannot do work!" The law was to put the people aging 75 years and above to be abandoned in the mountain. The cruel governor also added, "All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives." This low made the young farmer very sad for his mother was very old. Though he loved his mother, he must obey the governor The young farmer carried his mother to the mountain with a heavy heart. On their way to the mountain, the mother dropped small twigs as markers to help her son get back. When the farmer bade farewell, she advised hiin to return home with the aid of the twigs. This made the son make up his mind to take his mother back home. Filled with dread, he hid his mother in his home. Their kitchen, where he keeps their food, became his mother's new place to live, Time passed, and the farmer was beginning to feel safe when the governor had announced a demand to all of his people that he wanted a rope of ash. Nobody in the village could make one, it was impossible. The farmer became anxious with the governor's demand, so he asked his mother if she knew how to make one. His old mother, filled with the wisdom she gained from her years of living, had smiled to show her son that the govemor's demand is not impossible. She said, "Son, make a rope from a twisted straw." Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes. The governor became happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the farmer tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The fariner had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom. 36. What punishment would the governor give to those who might disobey the law? A. The relatives of those who will disobey will be put to death B. All who will disobey will be buried at the topmost part of the mountain. C. Any citizen who will disobey will be buried alive by his/her relatives. D. All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives. 37. How did the young farmer respond to the law of the governor? A. He must obey the governor B. He would defy the governor's law. C. He should hide his mother from the governor's eyes. D. He could not possibly follow the govemur because he dearly loved his mother 38. What did the govemor think about his demand in making a rope of ash? A. Nobody in the village could make a rope of ash. B. Only the governor himself can make the rope of ash. C. Somebody from the village could make a rope of ash D. It is impossible that someone can think of a way in making a rope of ash. 39. What was the young farmer's reaction upon knowing the governor's demand? A He was certainly desperate. B. He thought that he should not inform his mother about the demand C. He told the other villagers that he could make the govemor's demand D. He did not tell the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. 40. What could be the decision of the governor after knowing that it was the young farmer's aged mother who taught him how to make a rope of ash? A He would ask the young farmer to be one of his trusted men​</h2><br />

                            8. I DID UR MOM LOLLOThe title of this specific piece of poetry is “A Small Elegy”. Now, this title does not really give a reader much to go on. The only thing one would know about this poem is that it is a small one and that it may be about a deceased person or someone who new someone who dies. I say this because elegy is derived from the Latin elegia, which means; A poem or song composed especially as a lament for a deceased person.From the beginning, “A Small Elegy” dramatically establishes that the speaker a stand-in for the poet, is by himself talking to himself. He was with other people, but now he is completely alone–his friends gone, his beloved sleeping elsewhere, unconscious, far away. The speaker is the sole operating consciousness mourning in a world where everyone else is asleep. Against the pitch-black darkness he starts saying things to himself, using white words, which I take to mean words that have a kind of unselfconscious purity about them.He daydreams about his mother ,an “autumnal recollection”, and that in turn moves him back toward his childhood home where his mother seems still to preside–diminished now over an outmoded world. She is smaller, more vulnerable, someone to be protected. “Matku,” he says tenderly in Czech, “Mon maminku,” my little mommy, which the translator has rendered as “my diminutive mom. ” He imagines that after all these years she’s still sitting back there, quietly uncomplaining, thinking about his father who died so long ago.It is the next moment in the poem, when the tense radically changes, that I find especially compelling. “And then she is skinning fruit for me,” he says, “I am in the room. Sitting right next to her. ” He doesn’t say “And then she was skinning fruit for me,” but instead finds himself catapulted into the past as a living present. He has been wrenched out of one time into another.The amplitude of his feeling is nearly unbearable and he starts shaking his fist at God, using a child’s language, calling him a ”bully” because now he is aware that God has taken away so much, because so much is lost. And he then proceeds with the ruthlessness of a logical proposition to face what can no longer be evaded. “Because of all those hours I slept soundly, through calm nights,” he declares that is, because of all those nights when he was safe and unconscious.Because of all the loved ones who are deep in dreams” That is, because of all those who are unconscious now, unaware of the peril that surrounds them he realizes that time is running out and announces: “I can’t stand being here by myself. The lamplight’s too strong. ” Here the lamplight becomes the emblem of a consciousness that is too much to bear, an isolation that is killing: “I am sowing grain on the headland. I will not live long. ” The recognition here is that what he is planting is endangered, imperiled, and vulnerable.What he plants he will not be able to protect. The sowing of grain on the headland is his last gesture, his way of putting a message in a bottle when he knows he won’t last much longer. The poem concludes with a terrible recognition. When I read it, my impulse is to wake up everyone around me everyone l love before it is too late. In conclusion this poem is just one stanza that contains twenty-four lines. The poet refers to the speaker as ‘I’ and he also uses the words ‘my’ and ‘myself’ which lead me to the conclusion that this poem was written in the first person.The speaker in this poem recalls his past after his friends have left and his “darling” (wife, girlfriend, child) is asleep. He first begins to think of his mother then gets to his father. The speaker is empty inside because he has suffered so much great loss. He has suffered so much that he curses God and calls him a “bully” and he says to himself that he cant stand being alone for any longer and he also says that he will not live long which may imply that his life may end sooner than it has to=</h2><br />

                            9. This is not a Question I just want to help who need to find the plot of train to busan, you can see here too the main characters Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies. Once regrouped, they struggle through the horde to the front car, where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. However, the homeless man steps on a soda can, alerting the zombies to their location, and Seok-woo and Sang-hwa attempt to hold off the zombies, but Sang-hwa is bitten. At Yon-suk's instigation, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to enter the car by force by allowing all the zombies to eat him. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the vestibule. However, Jong-gil – disgusted at the passengers' selfishness and despairing the loss of her sister, who has become a zombie – allows the zombies to enter and kill them all. And because the other passengers had forced Seok-woo's group to isolate, his group remains safe. Yon-suk also escapes by hiding in the bathroom with a train attendant, with the survivors breaking off into groups, with Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, Jin-hee, Yong-guk, and the homeless man in one group, and Yon-suk, and the final train attendant in the otherA blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk pushes Jin-hee, the train captain, and the train attendant to the zombies to save himself and Jin-hee is bitten. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. Meanwhile, a flaming locomotive derails and the survivors are trapped under a train full of zombies. As the zombies drop by breaking the windows, the homeless man sacrifices himself so that Seok-woo has time to save Su-an and Seong-kyeong through a small hole under the derailed train. Realizing that there is a locomotive that still works, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, and Su-an narrowly avoid the zombies, and the three board the working locomotive and encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo manages to throw him off the train, but is bitten in the process. He teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his sobbing daughter, throwing himself off the train before he turns into a zombie. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong stop at a tunnel. They continue following the tracks on foot. Snipers stationed on the other side prepare to shoot at what they believe to be zombies. Upon hearing Su-an sobbing and singing "Aloha ʻOe" for her father, they lower their weapons, realizing the pair are human, as they help get them to safety.​</h2><br />

                            15. The Story of the Aged Mother A Japanese Folktale (An excerpt) By Matsuo Basho Long ago, in a tiny village in Japan, there lived a young farmer and his old mother. They lived well but simply until the cruel governor declared a wicked law. He said, "I have no desire for old people in my village. They are weak and cannot do work!" The law was to put the people aging 75 years and above to be abandoned in the mountain. The cruel governor also added, "All who will disobey the law must be put to death together with their old relatives." This law made the young farmer very sad for his mother was very old. Though he loved his mother, he must obey the governor. The young farmer carried his mother to the mountain with a heavy heart. On their way to the mountain, the mother dropped small twigs as markers to help her son get back. When the farmer bade farewell, she advised him to return home with the aid of the twigs. This made the son make up his mind to take his mother back home. Filled with dread, he hid his mother in his home. Their kitchen, where he keeps their food, became his mother's new place to live. Time passed, and the farmer was beginning to feel safe when the governor had announced a demand to all of his people that he wanted a rope of ash. Nobody in the village could make one, it was impossible. The farmer became anxious with the governor's demand, so he asked his mother if she knew how to make one. His old mother, filled with the wisdom she gained from her years of living, had smiled to show her son that the governor's demand is not impossible. She said, "Son, make a rope from a twisted straw." Then she added, "Stretch it on a flat stone and burn it there on a windless night." The farmer did what his mother told him, and amazingly it worked. He told the other villagers that he could make the governor's demand. Immediately, the farmer was sent to the governor's place to show him the rope of ashes. The governor became happy to see how smart his people are from accomplishing a difficult task. To his joy, he asked the farmer where he got his wisdom. This made the farmer tremble in fear and immediately bowed down to the governor, begging for forgiveness. The farmer had told him about his mother and how he was able to create the rope of ashes. The governor became silent and had thought deeply for a while. At that moment, he abolished his law on abandoning the old people. He would not kill the elders anymore because they had great wisdom.

                            16. The Two BrothersEgyptian Folktale1Once, there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother to live with him and treated him like a son. When the lil' bro grew into a young man, he was an excellent worker. He did the plowing and harvested the corn; there was not an equal in the land. Behold the spirit of a god was with him.2Every morning, the younger bro followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields and every evening he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother and at dawn, he took the bread with him which he had baked and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him his bread and drove the cattle into the field.3Because Anpu loved his brother very much, his wife became jealous and wanted to destroy Bata. One day when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said, "Get up and give me some corn so that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay."4At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which she had painted black and blue, and accused Bata of having beaten her. She pretended to be in great pain. She didn't give him water to wash his hands with, she didn't light the fire for him, she pretended that she was very sick. And Anpu became very angry; he sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable.5When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual loaded with herbs, milk, and wood. And as he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang at him and Bata fled praying to Ra, "My good lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good." And Ra heard his cry; he made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles. And Bata said to his elder brother, "Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father?6And has not your wife been as a mother to me? Now, since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia." Anpu answered, "Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her?" Bata answered, "I did no such thing. Have I not told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?" So Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then he sat down, poured ashes on his head, and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of the Acacia. There was no one with him; he slew wild beasts for food and built himself a house under the acacia tree, which is sacred to the gods.7One day as he walked out of his house, he met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, "Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone. And Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess and Bata loved her very much.What lesson did you learn from the story?​</h2><br />

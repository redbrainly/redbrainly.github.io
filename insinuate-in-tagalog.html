Those who have insinuated that Menard devoted his life to writing a contemporary
Quixote besmirch his illustrious memory. Pierre Menard did not want to compose
another Quixote, which surely is easy enough—he wanted to compose the Quixote.
Nor, surely, need one have to say that his goal was never a mechanical transcription
of the original; he had no intention of copying it. His admirable ambition was to
produce a number of pages which coincided—word for word and line for line—with
those of Miguel de Cervantes.

                            22. Direction: Give your own brief interpretation of each literary peace that contains
intertextuality.
Those who have insinuated that Menard devoted his life to writing a contemporary
Quixote besmirch his illustrious memory. Pierre Menard did not want to compose
another Quixote, which surely is easy enough—he wanted to compose the Quixote.
Nor, surely, need one have to say that his goal was never a mechanical transcription
of the original; he had no intention of copying it. His admirable ambition was to
produce a number of pages which coincided—word for word and line for line—with
those of Miguel de Cervantes.

                                            ACTIVITY EVERYONE HAS FEELINGS Psychosocial Competency: Self-awareness and Self-expression (Individual work) ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION: This activity helps learners identify their feelings, express them through art, and discover that people can experience more than one feeling at a time. RECOVERY OBJECTIVE: Develop self-exploration and self-awareness, practice self-expression, as well as gain a sense of empathy toward others. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Enhance vocabulary for naming feelings and practice abstract thinking by making associations between colors, shapes, lines, or images and feelings. MATERIALS NEEDED: Any paper available, markers, crayons, paints, other assorted materials. INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDE: Explore our feelings for today, sometimes, when we pay close attention to ourselves and give time to actually check in with how we are feeling, we might notice that we have more than one feeling at a time. Remember that is normal, especially in the time of a pandemic or disaster, and other transitions we might be going through. There are no right or wrong emotions and that paying attention to how we feel can give us information about ourselves and how we can handle situations. 1. Prepare piece of paper and coloring materials. 2. Settle and quiet down in own space on the floor. 3. Gently close your eyes and identify your feeling/s right now. 4. Open your eyes "How are you feeling today?" 5. On your sheet of paper, draw a picture with the colors that match the way you feel right now.​</a>

                        Making Connections <p>There are three ways we can make connections. One is by connecting oneself with the text. Second is by finding connections between texts. The third one is by connecting the text with the world. These connections explains how  previous experiences, knowledge, emotions. These help us identify what and how we learn. </p><p></p>Learning Task 2:Answers:text - world connectiontext - self connectiontext - self connectiontext - world connectiontext - text connectiontext - text connectiontext - text connectiontext - self connectiontext - self connectiontext - world connection<p></p>Things to Remember:Text-to-self connections are highly personal connections that a reader makes between a piece of reading material and the reader’s own experiences or life. An example of a text-to-self connection might be, "This story reminds me of a vacation we took to my grandfather’s farm."
When reading, readers are reminded of other things that they have read, other books by the same author, stories from a similar genre, or perhaps on the same topic. These types of connections are text-to-text connections. Readers gain insight during reading by thinking about how the information they are reading connects to other familiar text. “This character has the same problem that I read about in a story last year,” would be an example of a text-to-text connection.Text-to-world connections are the larger connections that a reader brings to a reading situation. We all have ideas about how the world works that goes far beyond our own personal experiences. We learn about things through television, movies, magazines, and newspapers. Often it is the text-to-world connections that teachers are trying to enhance when they teach lessons in science, social studies, and literature. An example of a text-to-world connection would be when a reader says, "I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article."<p></p><p>How can we make connections to the text: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/6670189</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />

                            11. ACTIVITY EVERYONE HAS FEELINGS Psychosocial Competency: Self-awareness and Self-expression (Individual work) ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION: This activity helps learners identify their feelings, express them through art, and discover that people can experience more than one feeling at a time. RECOVERY OBJECTIVE: Develop self-exploration and self-awareness, practice self-expression, as well as gain a sense of empathy toward others. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Enhance vocabulary for naming feelings and practice abstract thinking by making associations between colors, shapes, lines, or images and feelings. MATERIALS NEEDED: Any paper available, markers, crayons, paints, other assorted materials. INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDE: Explore our feelings for today, sometimes, when we pay close attention to ourselves and give time to actually check in with how we are feeling, we might notice that we have more than one feeling at a time. Remember that is normal, especially in the time of a pandemic or disaster, and other transitions we might be going through. There are no right or wrong emotions and that paying attention to how we feel can give us information about ourselves and how we can handle situations. 1. Prepare piece of paper and coloring materials. 2. Settle and quiet down in own space on the floor. 3. Gently close your eyes and identify your feeling/s right now. 4. Open your eyes "How are you feeling today?" 5. On your sheet of paper, draw a picture with the colors that match the way you feel right now.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Blue </strong>is the color I decided to use today to symbolize my emotions. I simply feel at <strong>calm </strong>and <strong>content </strong>for the day, and I don't believe anything noteworthy or unusual occurred. I chose the color blue because it is calming to the eyes and to the soul on a day like this one, which is simply another typical day for me. My daily schedule consists of getting up, going to school, listening to and studying the lessons my instructor assigns, eating when it's time to eat, and then leaving for home after class. I will then eat dinner with my family and go to bed. And I think that's all.</p><p></p><p>Because I have no expectations of anyone or anything, I feel <strong>content </strong>for the time being. "Come what may," according to the quote, merely makes me feel comfortable and at peace. Whatever occurs will occur. Simply said, I prefer not to invite too many feelings on this day. I kind of like not wanting to feel happy or sad on this particular day. Simply serene and content And for me, that's sufficient.</p><p></p><p>To learn more, just click the link below:</p><p>brainly.ph/question/29256451</p><p>brainly.ph/question/29213378</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

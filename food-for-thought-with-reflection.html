This isconciselywhere one's ability to compose a precis comes in handy because it allows one to statehis point of view in a short, yet logical and clear manner.In the previous lesson, you learned that one way of extracting informationfrom a text is by summarizing. Today, we are going to learn another way of extractinginformation.But first, let us reflect on this question “What makes us human?"A human's purpose in life is a choice. We decide what we want to do with ourlives based on our history, experiences, and the knowledge we have gathered. Thisdefines who we are.Here is a text with ideas about being a human that you can ponder over. Readcarefully and understand its message. Then, let's try to answer the followingquestions below. Write your answers on your notebook.Sample Reading Text:When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the wholeof our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings.We notice that whole nature resembles social animals. We eat food that others haveproduced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built.The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by otherpeople though the medium of a language which others have created. Withoutlanguage and mental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable tohigher animals.We have therefore to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the leastto the fact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth wouldremain primitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we canhardly imagine. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has,not much in virtue of the individuality, but rather as a member of a great humancommunity, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle tograve.https://www.coursehero.com/file/p13g2bh/Sample-5-When-we-survey-oulives-and-efforts-we-soon-observe-that-almost-th​</a>

It is challenging to identify a particular Asian culture or universal components among the immense diversity that has emerged from many cultural fields and three of the four ancient River valley civilizations. The continent is typically split into six geographical sub-regions, each of which can be distinguished by observable similarities in things like culture, religion, language, and a degree of ethnic homogeneity. Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia are among these regions.</p><p></p><p>Asia is home to several of the world's earliest civilizations, which generated the majority of the main religious systems, the oldest known recorded mythologies, and the codices on<strong> ethics and morality.</strong> Asia is also the world's largest, most populous continent and is wealthy in resources.</p><p></p><p>But due to Asia's immense size, the numerous civilizations are spread across vast distances and inhospitable landscapes like deserts and mountain ranges. However, trade and commerce progressively took on a truly international, Pan-Asian character by confronting and bridging these boundaries. The enormous road network and numerous maritime connections were used as a means of interregional trade, which served as a unifying and driving force in the dissemination of cultural components and ideas throughout the various sub-regions.</p><p></p><p>A unique method to depict Southeast Asia's culture, or rather, our lifeblood.

Today, we are going to learn another way of extractinginformation.But first, let us reflect on this question “What makes us human?"A human's purpose in life is a choice. We decide what we want to do with ourlives based on our history, experiences, and the knowledge we have gathered. Thisdefines who we are.Here is a text with ideas about being a human that you can ponder over. Readcarefully and understand its message. Then, let's try to answer the followingquestions below. Write your answers on your notebook.Sample Reading Text:When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the wholeof our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings.We notice that whole nature resembles social animals. We eat food that others haveproduced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built.The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by otherpeople though the medium of a language which others have created. Withoutlanguage and mental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable tohigher animals.We have therefore to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the leastto the fact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth wouldremain primitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we canhardly imagine. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has,not much in virtue of the individuality, but rather as a member of a great humancommunity, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle tograve.https://www.coursehero.com/file/p13g2bh/Sample-5-When-we-survey-oulives-and-efforts-we-soon-observe-that-almost-th​</h2><br />

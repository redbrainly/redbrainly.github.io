The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?
4. What social issues or problems did it present?
5. In what way, Social Science can be significant in solving such problem?</a>

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19. Since the Ukraine invasion began on February 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with at least 140 yes votes. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special military operation" to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 20. Despite decades of international climate negotiations, carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily, with current emissions projections putting 1.5 degrees C well out of reach. 21. Tight global energy markets and high fuel prices have led big energy consumer nations like the United States to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term-reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security, 22. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic human rights violations.​</a>

The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?

                            22. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19.

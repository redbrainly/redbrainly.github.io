                        <p>yung short mabilis lang </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Both short stories and plays use minimal background, description and explanations, leaving character development to the dialogue in the story. Readers or viewers pick up information about the characters in bits and pieces, through lines they speak, clothing they wear and how they interact with other characters. By contrast, novels often have long passages describing the thoughts, feelings and backgrounds of characters, allowing the reader to quickly have a view of who they are and what their motivations are.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Dialogue in a short story</strong>= partly responsible for revealing a character’s personality, <strong>Dialogue in a Play</strong>= totally responsible for revealing the characters s and also carry the story forward.  </p><p></p><p><strong>3. </strong>Both plays and short stories use dramatization to reveal character and plot. Good short stories, then, have dialogue and action that is similar to a play. For example, instead of explaining action, a story shows it. Rather than saying, "Peter told Annie that his ex-wife and their children would be coming for dinner without giving her any explanations," a short story would dramatize by saying, "Janet and the kids are coming for dinner tomorrow," Peter announced. "What?" countered Annie, but Peter did not respond as he walked out the front door." In both short stories and plays, the audience should be shown and not told.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. </strong>Setting in a short story is sometimes explicitly stated, but often revealed one tidbit at a time, such as a character's mentioning the year, or the weather in their location. In a play, the setting is stated in the stage directions for readers, but is revealed to play viewers through backdrops and costumes as well as spoken lines. </p><p></p><p><strong>5. </strong>Like most forms of literature, plays and short stories share elements of setting, conflict and plot. Conflict is what drives any work of literature, and both plays and short stories have at least one conflict. Although literary works often play games with plot, having a beginning, a middle and an end is generally common to a short story, with a climax of action then a denouement, or falling action, at the end.</p><p></p><p>Both short stories and plays use minimal background, description and explanations, leaving character development to the dialogue in the story.

                        <p>1. <strong>Our moral character can change through time and experiences.</strong>  We get to see a broader perspective in life, and that enables us to change and be better, or not.  For example, a person who has gone through a lot of sufferings in life will alter his morality over time.  He either becomes empathetic of others, or his temper is too unstable to manage.  He becomes angry of the tiniest of things or too sensitive to deal with his situation.  So over time, our personalities are affected by our circumstances and victories.
</p><p></p><p>2. One of the negative traits that highly affects one’s life decisions is <strong>impatience</strong>.  The more impatient we become, the more we become hard on ourselves and even to other people.  We do not truly value the essence of right timing and so it becomes one of our crucial life transitions.  Impatience leads to more mistakes and failures.
</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>If the youth ever lacked the morality to stand up for our country, then the country must be doomed.</strong>  This is the very reason the parents, guardians, or mentors are held accountable in the formation of the youth in their first few stages in life.  However, the society is not entitled to blame these support group for the youth become solely responsible of their life decisions once they reach the right age and if they can decide on their own.  Over the years, the youth should be expected to make alignments in their life directions.

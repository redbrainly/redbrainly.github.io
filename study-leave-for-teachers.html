In all cases, the study leave period shall be counted for seniority and pension purposes. The compensation allowed for one year study leave as herein provided shall be subject to the condition that the teacher takes the regular study load and passes at least seventy-five per cent of his courses.

                                            Hi, to whoever is reading this, I am not gonna ask a question or anything but I just want you to know that whatever kind of schoolwork, assignments, or anything that you are to answer, I know that you can do it because however hard it may be, I know that you can do it. And the new normal may not be your cup of tea but we need to live with it because, if we keep on complaining about it, nothing is gonna happen. And about online classes, please remember that if a teacher will ask something, don't be afraid to try, answer the teacher's question even if you are unsure of it if you are scared that others might make fun of you for getting it wrong, then just leave them to it because deep down you tried your best, and a teacher of mine once said, it is better to answer even if you don't know it rather than to not answer even if you know it. I hope that this will inspire you to continue with your studies even if you don't like it. Have a great day :)</a>

                            24. Hi, to whoever is reading this, I am not gonna ask a question or anything but I just want you to know that whatever kind of schoolwork, assignments, or anything that you are to answer, I know that you can do it because however hard it may be, I know that you can do it. And the new normal may not be your cup of tea but we need to live with it because, if we keep on complaining about it, nothing is gonna happen. And about online classes, please remember that if a teacher will ask something, don't be afraid to try, answer the teacher's question even if you are unsure of it if you are scared that others might make fun of you for getting it wrong, then just leave them to it because deep down you tried your best, and a teacher of mine once said, it is better to answer even if you don't know it rather than to not answer even if you know it. I hope that this will inspire you to continue with your studies even if you don't like it. Have a great day :)</h2><br />
